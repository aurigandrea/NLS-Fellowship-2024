This was an utterance, often accompanied by a sigh of relief, that was commonly used when the panic around COVID-19 started spreading.

I was and still am very disturbed with both the above statement and reactions – what Liddiard (2020) refers to as ‘ontologically violent messages’ – partly because I have family members and friends who belong to these ‘vulnerable’ groups.

I focus here on two implications in particular: 1) whose life/death matters and 2) the politics of vulnerability.

An ungrievable life is one that cannot be mourned because it has never lived, that is, it has never counted as a life at all.","neoliberal ableism is a naturalized apparatus of power that produces subjects, materially, socially, politically, and relationally. vulnerability isn’t a characteristic that certain individuals possess or embody. but it obscures the social and political dimensions of risk. it is ableism in action, working hand in glove with capitalism and white supremacy.",Covid,Covid,0.0842175409197807

Breast implant illness has gained more attention during the past 12 months and recent reports conclude that plastic surgeons, researchers, and other professional organisations are closely monitoring the situation surrounding whether Breast Implant illness does in fact exist.

What is the cause of breast implant illness?

There have been some proposals put forward that breast implant illness may be due to the woman’s body’s inflammatory reaction to the implant, which it sees as a foreign object.

In the same way, if patients don’t fully grasp the benefits and consequences of any treatment they will not feel in control of their health.

This results in a tailored service, with an actively engaged patient in control and fully informed at every stage.

For example, we can give them breaks if the treatment is a long session – this particularly benefits someone who is nervous about seeing the dentist and goes a long way to ensuring their treatment is carried out successfully.”",holistic dentistry helps people feel nervous if they don’t fully understand what is happening or why. if patients don’t fully grasp the benefits and consequences of any treatment they will not feel in control of their health. we prefer to use what we call 'Co-diagnosis and Co-treatment planning',Dental,Dental,0.4385958015918731

For overnight stays in hospital, since 2010 there has been a policy of “single-sex wards” recognising that sex matters in interactions with other patients.

After carefully setting up a system to record both sex and social gender, the NHS does not use it.

People requesting their medical records commonly find that the sex field is left blank and their sex is recorded as their gender.

– The GMC tells doctors to change a patient’s sex as recorded on medical records on request.","more than ten years ago the NHS recognised the need for clear systems for recording biological sex and social gender. the data standard set out definitions for patient “sex” and “current gender” and warned: “Users may confuse the terms current gender and sex, or assume that they are synonymous”.",LGBTQ,Services,0.0810536965727806
