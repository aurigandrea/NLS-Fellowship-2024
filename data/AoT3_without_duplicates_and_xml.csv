I’ve spent a lot of time looking for information about how to cope with my illness. I found some information on possible causes, the struggles people face with it and expensive miracle cures that offer no guarantee of success. I could never find what I was looking for- simple ways I could manage my illness on a day to day basis. I’d visited specific clinics, curated my own basic ways to manage the condition and believed this information could and should be readily available to anyone living with it. I also found art was a great way for me to express myself and visually explain the reality of my condition. And so, Creating with Chronic Fatigue was born.'"
