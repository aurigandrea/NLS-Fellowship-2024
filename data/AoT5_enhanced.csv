We are concerned that a proposed Bill to Ban Conversion Therapy may criminalise or ban exploratory therapy in the context of gender dysphoria.
We believe that ethical therapists would never carry out conversion therapy, and so the focus should be on protecting the integrity of the therapeutic process.
We are concerned about the consequences of the Memorandum of Understanding on Conversion Therapy.
This document seems to promote an affirmation-only approach for therapists working with individuals with gender-related distress, creating a ‘chilling effect’ for exploratory work.","therapeutic, therapists, integrity, conversion, thoughtful, thoughts, gender, ethical, work, therapy, individuals","Welcome to Thoughtful Therapists. We have come together with a shared concern about the impact of gender identity ideology on children and young people. We want to protect the integrity of the open-ended exploration of thoughts and feelings that has always been, and is still now, the basis of ethical and effective therapy.

We are concerned that a proposed Bill to Ban Conversion Therapy may criminalise or ban exploratory therapy in the context of gender dysphoria. The push to affirm a client’s gender identity, without exploration or neutrality, will be detrimental to both therapists and clients who want to work in this area.

We believe that ethical therapists would never carry out conversion therapy, and so the focus should be on protecting the integrity of the therapeutic process. We do not agree with faith-based conversion practices and we do not consider these to be either ethical or therapeutic.

We are concerned about the consequences of the Memorandum of Understanding on Conversion Therapy. This document seems to promote an affirmation-only approach for therapists working with individuals with gender-related distress, creating a ‘chilling effect’ for exploratory work. There is no long-term, high-quality evidence base to support affirmation-only and we fear that the MoU limits the range of therapeutic options available to individuals who are endeavouring to freely explore their innermost thoughts and feelings.

It is also absolutely clear from Employment Tribunal decisions (Forstater, Bailey, Fahmy, Meade, Phoenix and Adams among others) that therapists can hold and express gender critical beliefs within their work setting and are legally protected in doing so.

One of these studies also revealed that vegan women had a 34 per cent lower risk of female-specific cancers (Tantamango-Bartley et al., 2013).
Perhaps unsurprisingly, since food passes through the stomach, vegetarians were shown to have a whopping 63 per cent lower risk of stomach cancer (Appleby and Key, 2016).
These have a very high potential for causing cancer (Jariyasopit et al., 2014; Papaioannou et al., 2014).
And there’s yet another reason why animal products may increase your cancer risk – insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1).","al, slash, growth, meat, cancers, cancer, health, diets, et, lower, risk","Read the evidence

Cancer patients tend to have decreased levels of white blood cells that are crucial for a healthy immune response – this is a big risk factor for Covid-19 (Gosain et al., 2020). Hospital data show that cancer doubles the risk of infection with severe symptoms requiring hospitalisation. (Dai et al., 2020; Sidaway, 2020).

Cancer is a very complex, serious condition and a diet change alone cannot cure it. However, we can significantly lower our chances of developing it by changing our diet and lifestyle.

According to a large study from Oxford University, if you’re vegan, you have a 19 per cent lower risk of developing cancer compared to meat-eaters (Key et al., 2014). This result corresponds with other scientific studies that show 15-18 per cent lower cancer rates in vegans (Huang et al. 2012; Tantamango-Bartley et al., 2013; Dinu et al., 2017; Segovia-Siapco and Sabaté, 2019). One of these studies also revealed that vegan women had a 34 per cent lower risk of female-specific cancers (Tantamango-Bartley et al., 2013).

Perhaps unsurprisingly, since food passes through the stomach, vegetarians were shown to have a whopping 63 per cent lower risk of stomach cancer (Appleby and Key, 2016). Lower down the digestive tract, it’s clear why fibre from plant foods is so important – there is a 10-13 per cent decrease in the risk of colorectal cancer for each 10 grams of fibre consumed from plant-based wholefoods (Aune et al., 2011; Murphy et al., 2012).

Gray et al. (2020) suggested several mechanisms for the protective effects of plant-based diets – vegans tend to have healthier weight which lowers the risk of obesity-related cancers, such as colon, breast and prostate cancers; vegan diets contain more fruits and vegetables, which contain phytochemicals, antioxidants, fibre, flavonoids and vitamin C, all proposed to have protective effects against the development of cancer; and high consumption of pulses may decrease the risk of prostate cancer. This is complemented by the fact that the absence of red meat is also an important factor since it has been strongly associated with the development of colon, oesophagus, liver and lung cancers; and the absence of eggs in vegan diets may lower the risk of pancreatic cancer.

Vegan diets containing soya and cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, kale, watercress, rocket, radishes and cabbage) may also offer additional cancer protection. Soya consumption has been linked to a lower risk of certain types of cancer – breast, prostate, ovarian and bowel cancers (Chatterjee et al., 2018; Rizzo and Baroni, 2018). And cruciferous vegetables contain natural compounds that actively combat cancer cells and help protect our long-term health (Soundararajan and Kim, 2018).

Meat has been repeatedly linked to cancer, the World Health Organisation (WHO) classified processed meat as carcinogenic and red meat as probably carcinogenic (Bouvard et al., 2015). Even small amounts of red and processed meat have been shown to increase your risk of colon, breast and prostate cancer (Wolk, 2017).

Cooking meat at high temperatures produces dangerous compounds called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and heterocyclic amines. These have a very high potential for causing cancer (Jariyasopit et al., 2014; Papaioannou et al., 2014). Some substances added to processed meat, such as nitrites, can lead to the formation of carcinogenic N-nitroso compounds, which is another reason why processed meat poses such a big cancer risk.

Then, there are polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). These industrial pesticides were banned worldwide more than 30 years ago because of their toxicity but they are still present in our environment. Once in the body, PCBs accumulate in the fat tissue and can cause serious health issues, including cancer. A review on PCBs revealed that in the food chain, fish, dairy, hamburgers and poultry are the most contaminated foods (Crinnion, 2011).

And there’s yet another reason why animal products may increase your cancer risk – insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). It’s a growth hormone naturally produced by your liver, vital to childhood growth and stimulating cell growth and reproduction in adults. However, IGF-1 also promotes cancer cell growth and that’s why increased IGF-1 levels are considered dangerous (Jenkins et al., 2006). Scientists warn that whey proteins from dairy products cause a rise in insulin, IGF-1 and growth hormone levels in the human body (Melnik et al., 2011). The association between dairy intake and cancer is the strongest for prostate cancer (Travis et al., 2016) and there is also substantial evidence for the same mechanism and breast cancer (Bradbury et al., 2015). It’s worth noting that vegans have been found to have significantly lower levels of IGF-1 than meat-eaters (Allen et al., 2000 and 2002; McCarty, 2014).

​

Our Purpose Supporting disadvantaged and marginalised women and girls to have a fair chance at a better life.

​

Our Mission Women's Health Matters exists to support women and girls to live safe and healthy lives. We achieve this by providing a holistic, trauma-informed service for women and girls who are socially, economically, or politically marginalised. This includes, but is not limited to, those affected by domestic abuse, those whose children live elsewhere, those accessing maternity services, women seeking asylum, women with disabilities, and women and their children experiencing trauma.

We take a woman-centred holistic approach, creating a safe, nurturing environment to help women and girls recover their confidence, explore their own needs, regain control of their lives, and build secure and healthy family relationships.

​

Our Values

By women, with women - A women-led organisation, working with, and responsive to, the needs of women, their families, and girls.

Warm - We are respectful, compassionate, and kind. We provide welcoming and safe spaces and remove barriers to engagement.

Brave - We are bold, resilient, and courageous in our approach, and encourage bravery and strength in those we support.

Empowering - Women are the experts in their own lives. We work holistically to empower, inspire, and support them.

​

Who is WHM?

Women’s Health Matters was founded in 1987 by a group of women who recognised the struggles other women in their communities were having with mental health, domestic violence, poverty, and loneliness. They came together to provide support for those women, and, through dedication and hard work, Women’s Health Matters became a registered charity in 1995.

​

In the years since, though the staff and projects may have changed, our ethos at Women’s Health Matters has stayed the same; working together with women, their families, and girls to make their lives safer. The issues first identified in 1987 still impact women and girls in Leeds today and we continue to support and meet the needs of women and girls to make a place of safety, so that they have a better chance of a better life.

​

We work intensively with around 1200 women, their families, and girls each year in and around Leeds. These women and girls are most at risk, including those experiencing domestic violence, sexual and emotional abuse, those with children in care or at risk of being removed, women seeking asylum, women with learning disabilities, and women with complex needs or mental health and wellbeing needs. We also support with parenting and pregnancy choices. We take a woman-centred holistic approach, creating a safe, nurturing environment to help women and girls recover their confidence, explore their own needs and regain control over their lives.

​

We specialise in group work, peer support, and providing one-to-one support. Our broad health remit enables women and girls experiencing violence and abuse to raise these issues in safety and to receive support without stigma or partner suspicion. Our outreach work allows us to broaden our reach to a wide range of women who have often found it difficult to work with statutory services. We create a safe environment where women can build trusting relationships and begin to recover their health and regain control of their lives."

The NHS is built on the principle that we are each equal in dignity and worth. It expresses our commitment to protect one another’s right to life and to health, no matter who we are.

We recognise that the NHS faces unprecedented pressures. We know that its staff will have to make difficult decisions about who gets treatment and care and who doesn’t. We understand that they will have to judge whether people will benefit and we know that people’s existing health will be taken into account.

However, we have read about cases that have made us feel worried that the principles on which the NHS are built are sometimes not being upheld. We are concerned that the rights of disabled people, of all ages, as set out in the Human Rights Act (1998), the Mental Capacity Act (2005), the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act (2000), the Equality Act (2010) and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (2006) and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989) are not always being upheld. NHS staff normally use these laws to help make decisions about people’s treatment. In this crisis it’s more important than ever that all NHS staff follow them.

To ensure that this happens, we believe that it is critical that everyone involved is guided by the following principles:

Our individual chance of benefiting from treatment should we have Covid19 must not be influenced by how our lives are valued by society.

Where we have existing health conditions or impairments that are unrelated to our chance of benefiting from treatment, they must not play any part in decision-making regarding our equal right to access such treatment.

The fact that we might have significant levels of social care and support needs, or that we may do so in future as a result of the pandemic, should not make health staff think that we will not benefit from treatment.

We have the right to be fully involved in decisions about our own lives, including life and death decisions. Decisions should never be made without our involvement, or consideration of our best interests. There is no justification for policies based on age or learning disability that do not treat each of us with respect and as individuals.

We all, and our advocates, have the right to know about decisions that may be made about us that will affect us.

Guidelines on the assessment, provision, and evaluation of treatment and care provided to individuals during the Covid-19 pandemic must be developed in collaboration with disabled people’s organisations and representatives from human rights bodies.

We cherish the NHS and the values that it represents. We stand ready to do whatever we can to support it to stay true to its founding principles in the difficult days, weeks and months ahead.

In England, the COVID special leave provisions ended on 1 September 2022. Staff who contracted COVID-19 after 7 July are not eligible for any enhanced sick pay arrangements. Staff who contracted COVID-19 before 7 July who are off work with a COVID-19 related illness continued to receive full pay during a transition period from July 7 to August 31. Any period paid as COVID-19 sick leave prior to 1 September, regardless of length, will not be counted towards calculations of contractual sick pay or sickness absence triggers.

Similar arrangements are in place in Scotland, where COVID sick pay arrangements ended on 31 August 2022.

In Wales, the changes took effect from 1 July but NHS staff off with long COVID can still get full pay for up to one year from when they first went off sick. Staff will then be moved to half pay under normal contractual sickness arrangements.

In Northern Ireland, changes took place on 1 October 2022.

Primary care doctors

The support available for primary care doctors is less clear. Primary care has never had a clearly defined funding and management process for doctors suffering with long-COVID. Support processes are not clearly stated in any national guidance and funding support such as the General Practice COVID Capacity Expansion Fund in England, ended in September 2021. Sick pay provisions for GP partners are dependent on individual partnership agreements.

Locum doctors

The support available for locum doctors who are self employed in both primary and secondary care, has varied and has been unclear. Entitlement to COVID related sick pay has often been dependent on individual contractual arrangements. In addition, most locums are not entitled to Statutory Sick Pay unless agreed with the provider."

‘Absence’ is a word that arises consistently in the mind when considering the impact of Covid-19 on the UK’s blind and visually-impaired community. Vision impairment is a low-incidence disability and at best, we may suggest that its low prevalence may explain its apparent absence in the thought-process of the British government and institutions during the outbreak to supporting this community. However, I contend that the reason goes beyond ‘accidental forgetfulness’.

From potentially catastrophic delays in accessing crucial public health information due to inaccessible formatting of official documentation and guidance, to simply ITV failing to provide auditory back-ups to public service announcements broadcast about the filming of Coronation Street, there has been a distinct absence of care towards blind and visually-impaired people. This socio-political exclusion is symptomatic of their positioning as ‘abject and Other’ (Liddiard, 2020) by inherently dis/ableist attitudes that remain foundational in our society.

Medical Model

The adherence to the medical model of disability by the UK government during the Covid-19 pandemic has affected visually impaired people in unexpected ways. It has (re)positioned them within the margins of society, but in a new sense. The medicalisation of disability in crisis-reactive policy has not been used to perpetuate traditional stereotypes of blindness and deficit, in fact, (superficially at least) quite the opposite. It has instead positioned visually-impaired people as ‘normal’ (Davis, 2006) members of society. However, this ‘normal’ is absent of any positive connotations.

This ‘normal’ is a loaded term, and ”normality’ is a moving target’ (Shakespeare, 2007, p. 52). And in temporarily occupying the space of ‘normalcy’ from which they are usually excluded by bio-political oppressive forces, the visually-impaired community has found itself placed within the crosshair of Covid-19. Disablement has taken on new forms, as normative (mis)conceptions of ability are applied in a newly-directional, and potentially fatal, ways.

Othering

The Covid-19 outbreak has caused blind and visually impaired peoples’ lives to truly exist at the dis/abled hyphen (Goodley, 2014; Goodley & Runswick-Cole, 2014). They are ‘othered’ by their position within the new hierarchy of disability created by Covid – perceived as ‘not disabled enough’ to warrant governmental ‘protection’ and therefore, are unable to register on the national ‘vulnerable list’. Yet conversely, vulnerability is forced upon them due to their absence on this list by another absence – the absence of consideration of what it means to be access the world through tactile means when any surface can harbour a deadly viral load.

Blind people during COVID are expected to put their lives at risk to ‘pop to the shops’. They are subject to violence – a visually-impaired man was subject to attempted mugging by a gang who tried to take his shopping. They must run the gauntlet of touching products in supermarkets to hold them closer to maximise their residual vision. They must rely upon the goodwill and good behaviour of others in hoping they can avoid the compulsory intimacy (Hammer, 2013) that during other times can constitute simply an annoyance. Social distancing is a visually dialogic process that automatically absents visually-impaired people from possessing equality of power in public places. These public spaces extend to those in virtual realms.

The sweeping move online within the education sector has been done with little thought of those sitting outside normative societal categories. There has been an absence of thought of the inclusion those sitting outside normative societal categories. There has been an assumed equality of digital access. There has been a blasé approach to digital literacy. There has been a privileging of face-to-face and synchronous meetings. There has been little consideration the need for crip time (Kafer, 2013). As with the ablest and divisive concept of herd immunity, there has been herd accessibility. Screenshots of ‘Zoom’ meeting invites incompatible with screen-readers. Schools refusing to breach ‘deep-cleaned’ areas to send home pupils’ specialist assistive technology that have been locked on-site. A lack of modified resources provided on largely inaccessible virtual learning environments. The move online has been undertaken with an absence of access arrangements.

Campaigns

As seen in other countries, such as the Netherlands (as expanded on by Dr Alice Schippers in this collection), the response to addressing the inequality engendered by Covid-19 for visually impaired people has been mobilised by the blind community itself, alongside allies. The charitable sector has responded strongly to the absence of accessibility, with advocacy and activism. The Royal National Institute for the Blind has created a list of useful resources on its website, including modified versions of the government information leaflet that was sent to every household.

It has also been involved in the campaign, along with Thomas Pocklington Trust, Guide Dogs and Visionary, to have supermarkets allocate priority delivery slots to visually-impaired people. It has created an already-successful social media campaign demanding accessible content for official material (#InfoForAll). Its endeavours have been matched by smaller charities: VIEW has collated an exhaustive list of resources for home-schooling and leisure; VICTAR has extended grants for assistive technology; Look UK has created online fora and webinars to combat social isolation. This in turn has been echoed by individuals on social media, for example, by the creation of virtual socialising spaces like the Staying Inn on Twitter (@TheStayingInn). The blind community has inverted the narrative of absence by making its presence felt.

The unquestioned primary of ‘sightedness’

However, we cannot escape the fact that Covid-19 has served to solidify the position of the blind and visually impaired community as straddling the insider/outsider divide of British Society . It has been evident that there remains an absence of understanding at governmental level of the barriers that visually-impaired people face in everyday life caused by the unstinting and unquestioned primacy of ‘sightedness’ (Michalko, 1998). However, the aftermath of Covid-19 may signify a new world, so let’s make it a brave one – which rejects the notion that ‘the only valid ontology is the sighted one’ (Goodley 2014, p. 155). Let us move forward as a society in a way that re-makes our conceptions of accessibility, and in turn, re-make our institutions. Let us position accessibility at the heart of the changes that will come from this crisis – the embedment of ‘liberatory access… done in the service of love, justice, connection and community’ (Mingus, 2018). Let us consider ‘what can stories, bodies and things presently do, and what could they potentially do in a different context?’ (Monforte, 2019, p. 117), and let’s do it urgently to ensure we move forward with an absence of barriers, both physical and attitudinal.

The effect of the situation on the organisation and its staff

Speakup had a rapid response to the government’s instruction to stay at home. The day this instruction happened, Speakup people with learning disabilities, autism or both had been working on a social distancing policy to keep people as safe as possible. Because of this, the group were already thinking about alternative ways of working.

Our services have had to radically change. First of all, we got in contact with our local council, Voluntary Action Rotherham and Community Catalyst, to make sure that our response was co-ordinated with theirs. We then asked our media engineer, who works with us to create accessible information and films, to set up Zoom meetings for us – which we have been holding daily. Our workers responsible for keeping Speakup on target are meeting at 9:00am, via Zoom, to plan the day. At 11:00am, we have a Zoom meeting that is open to all from Speakup, so that people can chat together, talk about their anxieties and frustrations, but also talk about any positive things that happened the day before. The meetings have been lively, challenging and fun.

Other than 2 self advocates we have needed to furlough, one being our caretaker and the other who unfortunately doesn’t have support to work from home, we have managed to keep all workers with learning disabilities and autism employed and created two further sessional positions.

Other workers without learning disabilities are overwhelmed with work but are managing this from home. Speakup is always incredibly busy and, because of heightened anxieties, the phones never stop. We have managed to get some of the Covid-19 funding, so the organisation is stable at present. However, after Christmas we drop out badly and we are very worried that funding pots at this time might be overwhelmed. We apply for funding weekly and this is a continuation of the ‘norm’.

The effect of the situation on the people we support

Our communities of interest are people with learning disabilities, autism or both, many of whom have enduring mental health conditions. The current ‘lockdown’ is causing people’s anxieties and levels of crisis to increase significantly.

Strategies and activities that have been implemented to mitigate the effects of 1&2

Due to COVID-19, our team of peer supporters have increased their support time to individuals out in the community. They are providing crisis support and one to one support with mental health and wellbeing through:

Daily group ZOOM calls which act as a virtual Advocacy Group for people

Daily one to one sessions with individuals to listen, advise and provide additional support to vulnerable people who are isolated and are experiencing increased anxiety and depression at this time

Weekly recurring planned group support sessions in the form of quizzes, mindfulness, massage, yoga, talking therapy, cooking and life skills which people can join – run by self-advocates

All these activities need continuity and sustainability, so that a best practice firm foundation is built – and as a legacy for the future, given the potential for the long lasting nature of this crisis.

What have you done differently? (descriptive)

Speakup has moved from a permanent large office space to remote working from home. Group work and one-to-one work is continuing, but via Zoom meetings or phone calls. This has worked surprisingly well and, for some of our members, gives them a structured time and ‘place’ in which to meet. For all the people involved in these activities, it has lessened social isolation and the only negative is when tensions rise and people fall out.

What did you learn? (reflective)

We have learned that we can diversify in ways that we never thought possible. The success of Zoom has been surprising and we will certainly continue Zoom methods of working when normal working patterns resume. We feel that genuine friendships have been made, which would not have happened had we continued our normal way of working. The social activities have also been really interesting to observe and fun for everyone involved.

What has gone wrong?

Because of heighted anxieties and group tensions, there are the occasional days that don’t go well; people may argue and occasionally fall out with others on the Zoom calls, quiz or WhatsApp. Generally, these have been resolved by private conversations between the aggrieved people concerned in the disagreement. At other times it has taken some mediation with an inclusion worker to sort things out.

Shielding issues

There are no issues at present; most people have some support. Speakup has had to deliver food to two people, but only on one occasion each. At other times, support circles have been available.

Free slots are online slot machines that are played without wagering. They are quite similar to casino slots in the way the game is played – reels are spinning, then stop and you either hit a pay line and win, or not. Slots are a game of chance, so there is really no strategy to win – you just have to be lucky. However, there are some things you can do to increase your chances of winning. One is to take advantage of free slots bonuses, which are given out by many casinos to encourage new players to sign up. These bonuses give you extra credits to play with, and you can often keep what you win up to a certain amount.

Free slots are the classic type of slot game. They do not offer any bonuses or free spins. Instead, they simply pay out based on the symbols that land on the reels. While this may seem like a disadvantage, it actually gives players a better chance of winning since there are no special features that can be used to manipulate the outcome. So if you're looking for a chance to win big at slots, take advantage of free slots bonuses and free spins. With a little luck, you could be the next big winner.

Bonus slots, on the other hand, do offer bonuses and free spins. These can be triggered by landing certain combinations of symbols or by meeting certain requirements. For example, some bonus slots require players to wager a certain amount of money before they can trigger the bonus. Others may require players to spin the reels a certain number of times.

Another way to increase your chances of winning at slots is to play with free spins. Free spins are basically extra spins that you get for free, from the casino. They can be given out as part of a promotion, or as a welcome bonus when you sign up. Free spins are a great way to try out a new game or casino, and they can often be played with no risk to your own money.

They came to us at all hours of the day and night giving us the help and support we needed and putting our minds at rest knowing my mother was in good hands.

Jonathan, from the Family Support team, supported me in a way that no one else has ever done, and our chats together helped me overcome some anxieties and come to terms with my mother’s passing. Due to the Covid-19 restrictions we spoke outside under a shelter at the Hospice and his calming words seemed to blend with the scenery. The hills, the trees, and the leaves seemed to rustle and speak in calming whispers.

The Hospice refused to let the pandemic hinder either treatment or care and whenever new restrictions or regulations threatened them in carrying out their duties, they found a way around it. Nurses and carers still came, and we slept at night because they continued to provide the support we needed.

The staff and volunteers at the Hospice were once strangers to us, but they treated us like their family.

How it all began:

Wendy held the first Hereditary Breast Cancer Awareness week to mark the launch of the helpline. This was warmly received by the whole genetic community and supported by the late Princess Diana (click the letter to the right to read). Two genes had at that time been found which, if faulty, conferred around an 80-90% breast cancer risk.

The main aim of the helpline was to ensure that those worried about their family history had access to full information on all the options currently available, referrals where appropriate, and full peer support for whatever option was chosen. Most importantly that those affected had the opportunity to make informed choices. It is also an important role of the helpline to reassure those worrying unnecessarily. To that end the Helpline has been enormously successful, given the feedback over this past 19 years.

From the outset one of the main problems was inequity of service. The Helpline was instrumental in bringing the ‘Management of women at risk’ to the attention of the DoH and in 2006 guidelines were developed and announced by NICE, with representation and approval from the Helpline. The Helpline has also been involved with the current moratorium on ‘Genetic testing and insurance’, and was also active in alerting the government to the worrying situation of the gene patent, which, if allowed to go forward, would have made genetic testing prohibitively expensive for the NHS, thus costing lives.

The Helpline is manned as near as possible 24 hours per day, every day, although an answering service is always available. To date many thousands of calls have been taken worldwide and Wendy has given numerous talks internationally. In 2001 Wendy was called upon to help advise on the launch of a similar incentive in the USA."

Since early 2023, The Junction has been working towards a Gold level LGBT Charter Award. The LGBT Charter, developed by LGBT Youth Scotland, supports The Junction to proactively support our staff and volunteers and to provide high quality services for LGBTQ+ young people. In 2019, we achieved a Silver Award and developed many inclusive practices which we maintained. However, we decided we were ready to push ourselves, to go the extra mile and go for Gold!

At the Junction, we hugely value inclusivity, and we work with a significant number of young people who identify under the LGBTQ+ umbrella. We feel it is vital that we ensure that our service does everything it can to welcome and include those who identify as LGBTQ+. The journey has been challenging and rewarding in equal measure. The programme expects a high standard, and rightly so – that means there has been some hard work and reflection involved.

We have appreciated the additional push to connect with partners in the sector, consult young people in more depth, put extra energy into celebrating LGBT History Month and key calendar dates, and to update our policies and guidance.

We hope that the additional inclusive practices and resources we have developed will help to ensure LGBTQ+ young people, staff and volunteers feel the Junction is a safe and welcoming place."

This year has been really tough for many charities. While there is much for us to be proud of at AUScot, we have found ourselves in an increasingly difficult position.

Like many charities this year, we have faced significant issues in attracting longer term funding, and having that funding arrive in a timely manner. This has been exacerbated by the fact we are a relatively new charity meaning many funds were simply not open to us, and many funders deciding to pivot away from supporting autistic people. The decision by the Scottish Government not to fund services for autistic children, having previously funded this for three years through the National Post Diagnostic Fund pilot, with very little notice, was a huge blow to autism charities and autistic persons organisations across Scotland.

This has made it increasingly difficult to maintain our staffing levels and services. It also put immense pressure on those staff we were able to retain, resulting in burnout. The board has worked with others looking at options to continue, however the lack of long term funding, and a lack of permanent staff from the end of January, has left us in a position where we need to close down the charity. We are beyond devastated that this is the case. This is not a decision we came to lightly, or that we wanted to make. We ask that you are gentle with our staff team while interacting with us as we are all doing our best in our time remaining.

We will be shutting down our services at the end of January, and our staff and Board are working hard to wind things up between now and then. We will be closing down our various services incrementally over the next month and a half.

We realise that this is distressing news to many of you and want to reassure people that we have worked hard to avoid this outcome. Many of those involved remain dedicated to the autistic community and are seeking ways to continue supporting as they can, this includes trying to find alternatives venues for the gaming group.

Marion and Flick, along with some volunteers, will continue running Autistic Pride Aberdeen each year.

We are making sure our resources section remains available, and we will provide details on that soon. There are many great organisations and autistic led pages on social media to follow, we hope that people we have supported will be able to access support from some of these sources.

We want to say a huge thank you to all of you for helping to make the community AUScot created so beautiful. We have loved all of our events, loved your comments on social media, loved your amazing emails. We have loved our 1:1 support sessions, groups, training, and all of the other services we have provided. While it is heart wrenching to leave, we go with many happy memories. Thanks to all of you!

Discover how you can care for your mental health while pregnant or caring for your new baby

Although it’s portrayed as one of the happiest times, it’s actually common for parents to experience perinatal mental ill health. This refers to mental health problems that occur any time from becoming pregnant to a year and longer after giving birth. In a survey by Benenden Health, 3 in 10 parents said they had experienced perinatal mental health issues. Here we share self-care techniques that you can use to look after yourself.

Having a baby is a huge life event and can trigger a wide range of perinatal mental health problems, including depression, anxiety, OCD, eating disorders, psychosis, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). If you or your partner experience these or any other mental health difficulties at any time, talk to your doctor, midwife, health visitor or post-NICU (Neonatal Intensive Care Unit) nurse.

There are other things you can be doing while waiting for professional support and many people find these self-care techniques make a big difference to how they’re feeling…

5 ways to look after your mental health during pregnancy



You're going through a lot of physical changes, but don't forget about your mental health.

1. Have early nights

Throughout pregnancy your energy ebbs and flows, so if you’re feeling really tired, give in and enjoy an early night. If you can’t sleep, try to relax with a book rather than TV or your phone as these can overstimulate you and make it harder to nod off.

2. Make time for you and your partner

This is a time of change for your partner as well, so make time to share with each other how you’re both feeling and enjoy doing the things you love together

3. Take it easy

Your body is going through a lot of physical and hormonal changes right now, so if people offer you help, take it!

4. Exercise gently

If you’re feeling up to it, a walk in the park, yoga, swimming, and Pilates are all good ways to relieve mental stress and improve your mood

5. Talk to friends, family or support groups

It’s OK to not feel excited or happy that you or your partner are pregnant and sharing how you’re feeling is often the first step to improving your mental health. It can be easier to talk to someone outside of your family and friends so there are lots of support groups offering online, phone and face-to-face support (when available) such as PANDAS

Looking after your mental health with a new baby



Whether you’ve been mentally well during pregnancy or not, life with a baby can impact on your mental health too. Many new parents feel tired, emotional and overwhelmed by the number of new things to learn. It can be a scary time with lots of new pressures that can change relationships and amplify any existing mental health illnesses.

Many parents experience what’s commonly called ‘the baby blues’ about three to ten days after birth. It’s characterised as low mood, feeling emotional and tearful but normally passes after a few days.

However, as parenthood isn't a short-term life event, mental ill health can be much longer lasting. There may be added struggles with breastfeeding and unexpected complications such as a premature birth, traumatic labour, or an ill mum or baby.

There are lots of self-care techniques (some of which are listed below) you can try to alleviate the symptoms and help you and your partner cope, but if you find your symptoms getting worse, you can talk to your doctor, midwife, health visitor, post-NICU group or call your Benenden Health 24/7 Mental Health Helpline.

12 ways for new parents to take care of their mental health



Making some time for your mental health is crucial...

1. Accept help with daily tasks

Everyday tasks like having a shower or cooking when you have a baby can feel impossible so if someone offers to cook or to come round and look after baby while you do the washing up, say yes! Let go of those daily tasks that aren’t essential.

2. Do what you can, when you can

Now your focus is on the little one, it’s only natural that daily tasks will slip. Ask yourself what really matters and try not to get frustrated when you can’t achieve everything. Try taking bursts of time here and there to do the things that really have to be done. You can achieve a lot in 20 minutes, and you’ll feel much better for it. With the first weeks of parenthood under your belt, it’s good for your mood to get dressed and freshen up every day (even if a shower is impossible).

3. Talk to your partner, family, and friends about your feelings

Mental health problems are common in parents so if you’re not feeling yourself, talk to family and friends you trust who are parents - chances are they might have felt something similar. Keep talking to your partner too as they can only support you if they know you’re struggling.

4. Contact support organisations

Talking to someone who has felt the same can often be the best medicine. There are support options for parents with premature or sick babies such as local support groups (when available) and phone helplines from PANDAS or Bliss and online communities such as Netmums Forums and NCT.

However, don’t forget that even if everything went ‘right’ with your birth and your baby is healthy, you may still be struggling with your perinatal mental health. You can reach out to PANDAS.

5. Go to parent and baby groups

Whether it’s mummy exercise classes in the park (when available) or baby sign language online, these groups are a vital lifeline for many parents to break up their days and to share their experiences with other parents.

6. Exercise or get outside

Mums’ physical health will have changed during pregnancy so a walk with the pram every day not only helps strengthen your muscles (especially your pelvic floor) but also has a positive impact on your mood.

7. Rest when you can

When baby sleeps it’s tempting to take the opportunity to get things done but make sure you remember to rest too. Even fifteen minutes a day sitting down will improve your mental health, consider downloading a mindfulness app using this whilst resting can improve mood, decrease anxiety, and establish a positive mental wellbeing routine.

8. Do something for you

If it’s possible, ask your partner to look after baby even for half an hour a day so you can do something for yourself. Whether you read a book, watch TV or call a friend, just doing something for you will make you feel refreshed.

9. Eat well and drink water

You may be trying to regain your pre-baby weight but rather than less food, now is the time for healthy meals that will give you the energy and nutrition your body needs. If you’re breastfeeding, the NHS recommends you drink plenty of water and keep caffeine down to a minimum.

10. Notice your mood

You may not have time to write a diary but keep a note (in your phone or in your head) of how you are feeling - can you see patterns in what makes things better or worse? There may be topics of conversation, places, or habits (like having caffeine or alcohol) that aren’t doing you good at the moment.

11. Use the internet wisely

When you have worries about you or your baby, trusted websites and apps are a great way to put your mind at rest or give you helpful tips, but social media images and stories portraying the perfect mother and baby moments, ‘over-sharenting’ or telling worse-case scenario stories will make any new parent feel inadequate or scared. Follow people you trust to be honest or unfollow the ones that make you feel anything but happy.

12. Be kind to yourself

One thing you can’t prepare for is how much being a new parent will change your focus and your use of time, so try to talk kindly to yourself. Celebrate the things you do achieve and the good moments you have with your baby but try not to over-criticise and over-focus on the things you don’t manage.

The COVID-19 pandemic has changed everything. It has disrupted global travel and the economy, and public health responses to the pandemic have curtailed democratic freedoms to an unprecedented degree in most western countries. The pandemic has also been accompanied by an “infodemic” of misinformation and conspiracy theories. In the UK, around 1 in 4 adults believe in at least one conspiracy theory relating to COVID-19.

In the UK, around 1 in 4 adults believe in at least one conspiracy theory relating to COVID-19.

Conspiracy theories and misinformation have demonstrable adverse consequences because they hinder our ability to respond effectively to a crisis.. For example, exposure to misinformation has been shown to reduce people’s intention to get vaccinated by 6% or more.

Given that widespread vaccination is a key ingredient to help the world recover from the pandemic, the effect of anti-vaccination misinformation is particularly concerning and renders communication about the COVID-19 vaccines – and encouraging vaccine uptake – particularly critical. To assist with this, an interdisciplinary team of more than 25 scientists worldwide has recently published a COVID-19 vaccination communication handbook. The handbook is freely available for download in 11 languages and provides specific hints about how to communicate the benefits of COVID-19 vaccines. It is aimed at all types of practitioners, from physicians and nurses to journalists and people in government, but also the public at large.

Inoculation

One of the techniques to combat misinformation that is explained in the handbook involves inoculation of the public against misinformation, ideally before it is encountered. To inoculate people involves two steps:

A warning that they may be misled A pre-emptive refutation of the misleading argument

Inoculation thus follows the biomedical analogy: By exposing people to a weakened dose of the techniques used in misinformation and pre-emptively refuting them, “cognitive antibodies” can be stimulated.

Inoculation has been successfully used against COVID-19 misinformation. In one study, people played a video game, called GO VIRAL! that trained players in creating viral misinformation using common misleading techniques. Learning how to create misinformation enabled people to detect when they were being misled after they finished playing the game.

Interestingly, inoculation has been shown to work across several domains, including political radicalisation. In one of our recent studies, participants were shown a video about how to identify misinformation techniques commonly used in Islamophobic and radical-Islamist material. Following this inoculation treatment, participants either watched an Islamophobic video or a video conduit to radical Islamist content. Both videos contained numerous items of misinformation. Individuals who received the inoculation displayed less agreement with the misinformation, demonstrated less sharing likelihood, and had less support for the misinformation. The results are encouraging because they show that inoculation can help combat extremist messages, a terrain that is usually considered very challenging.

The inoculation strategy was also effective without having to refute a specific incident of Islam-related disinformation. The virality and evolving nature of disinformation often make creating a catered rebuttal difficult, and the rebuttal may fail to reach the consumers. Thus, the notion of an intervention that combats disinformation without directly addressing specific examples of disinformation is encouraging.

The success of inoculation is not the only link between COVID-19 misinformation and radicalising material about Islam: both types of misinformation also have implications for national security. In the case of Islamophobia and radical Islamism, the impact on national security is immediately obvious. In the case of COVID-19, the implications are less clear but arguably also profound, as discussed next.

Blending of conspiracies

Across Europe, the pandemic was instrumentalised by the far right to push a strong nativist narrative, linking the pandemic to immigration, immigrants, and ethnic minorities. Far-right opposition parties in Europe also opposed any mandatory COVID-19 public-health measures, from mask-wearing to social distancing to COVID-19 tracking apps, largely based on misleading or outright false information.

Conspiracy theories about COVID-19 and the vaccines have now also become intertwined with QAnon. QAnon is a conspiracy theory that originated in 2017 on far-right chat sites in the US but has now moved closer to the mainstream and is spreading across the globe.

Although QAnon defies easy description, its core tenet is the allegation that a cabal of Satanic, cannibalistic paedophiles is operating a global child sex trafficking ring and conspired against former President Trump while he was in office. In May 2021, 15% of Americans endorsed at least one of three of the main claims of QAnon, confirming the attractiveness of the theory to a notable share of the population. QAnon has been identified as a national security risk by the FBI, and its adherents played a focal role during the violent insurrection at the US Capitol on 6 January 2021.

From early 2021 onward, anti-vaccination conspiracy theories have become increasingly prominent within the QAnon ensemble of baseless and easily disproven claims. The growing links between the far-right QAnon milieu and anti-vaccination conspiracies are not limited to the US. In Germany, for example, QAnon has close links to the so-called Querdenker movement, an umbrella term for people who oppose all aspects of COVID-19 public-health measures, from masks to social distancing to vaccinations. Querdenker members often ally with the extreme right, and their demonstrations often end in violence.

Pandemics have given rise to conspiracy theories for centuries. When people suffer a loss of control or feel threatened, they become more vulnerable to believing conspiracies. Pandemics also lead to major social change, and in the case of COVID-19, to restrictions on people’s civil liberties and freedoms. It is thus unsurprising that those two strands of consequences of pandemics should become intertwined.

The blending of political conspiracies and pandemic-related conspiracies is therefore also not entirely surprising. Given the clear potential for violence in the extreme-right conspiracy milieu, conspiracy theories relating to COVID-19 therefore also have national-security implications."

There is no evidence this is true. Nasal flu vaccinations have been safely given to some school children since 2013.

Nasal flu vaccines are causing the increase in strep A infections and deaths in young children.

Full Fact has identified dozens of false claims linking recent deaths in children from strep A infections in the UK to the nasal flu vaccine have been shared thousands of times on Facebook in recent days.

The nasal flu vaccine doesn’t contain strep A, and there is no evidence at all that the vaccination of school children against flu has anything to do with the increase in cases.

One post shared over 300 times says: “Four weeks ago, all UK PRIMARY aged children get live flu nasal spray. Today, primary aged children dying from strep [...] Dot to dot.”

Another social media user wrote, in a post shared more than 1,100 times: “Four weeks ago, UK school children received a ""floo""nasal spray. Today, there are children are dying [sic] from Strep-A.”

Another post, which has been copied, screenshotted and shared hundreds of times, explicitly claims that strep A infections are a side effect of the nasal flu spray.

Strep A, or group A streptococcus, is a type of bacteria sometimes found in the throat or on the skin. It usually causes mild illnesses such as a sore throat, though many people can carry the bacteria harmlessly without developing illness. In some cases it can cause scarlet fever, which is usually mild.

The symptoms of scarlet fever include a sore throat, headache, and fever, along with a fine, pinkish or red body rash with a sandpapery feel. On darker skin, the rash can be more difficult to detect visually but will also have a sandpapery feel.

The bacteria can also cause more serious and even life-threatening infections called invasive group A strep (iGAS) infections when the bacteria enters deeper into the body, sometimes including the bloodstream.

The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has said that there has been an increased rate of scarlet fever and invasive group A strep recently.

As of 2 December, sadly five deaths of children were recorded within 7 days of an iGAS diagnosis in children under 10 in England. Dr Colin Brown, deputy director of the UKHSA has said: “Make sure you talk to a health professional if your child is showing signs of deteriorating after a bout of scarlet fever, a sore throat, or a respiratory infection.”

The UKHSA advises parents to call 111 or see their GP if:

your child is getting worse

your child is feeding or eating less than normal

your child has had a dry nappy for more than 12 hours or is showing other signs of dehydration

your child has a high temperature (above 38°C in infants under three months, and 39°C in older children)

your baby is hotter than usual when you touch their back or chest or feels sweaty

or if your child is very tired or irritable.

If your child is having difficulty breathing, if there are pauses when your child breathes, if their skin, tongue or lips are blue or if they are floppy and will not wake up or stay awake, the UKHSA says parents should call 999 or go to A&E.

Nasal flu vaccine doesn’t contain strep A

Professor Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, told Full Fact: “Influenza vaccines do not contain group A streptococcus, they contain weakened strains of flu.

“They are very carefully regulated by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and are tested to show that there is no contamination with bacteria before they are released.

“Group A streptococcal bacteria are very common in children and spread from person-to-person, often without symptoms, but can commonly cause sore throats and very rarely severe disease as in the recent cases.”

Former chair of the BMA’s Public Health Medicine Committee Dr Peter English, a retired consultant specialising in communicable disease control, said there was “absolutely no plausibility to this claim”.

He added: “Flu infection increases the risk of subsequent bacterial infections. If anything, getting protected against flu is likely to decrease the risk of streptococcal infections.”

Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading told Full Fact: “The claims that it [the nasal flu vaccine] has group A strep bacteria in it are just nonsense. It would fail its quality control if that was the case.”

Professor Clarke also highlighted the fact that the nasal flu vaccine has been given to some school-aged children for almost a decade, without a prior increase in the rate of strep A infections.

Dr English, a former editor of Vaccines in Practice magazine, added: “We have been using this flu vaccine for years now, and in previous years the peak in streptococcal infections has arisen in spring, not in autumn.

“Whatever the reason why we are having an increase in iGAS [invasive group A streptococcal] infections now, the nasal influenza vaccine is not likely to be the cause.”

The nasal flu vaccine was first piloted for use in school children in 2013. Over the 2021/22 flu season, all children from age two up to those in year 11 were offered the flu vaccine, with this year’s rollout concentrated in children up to year 9, though children in year 10 and year 11 may be vaccinated if there is leftover product.

All children from reception to year 4 have been offered the vaccine in schools since 2016/17, and all children aged up to nine from 2018/19.

Study didn’t say nasal flu vaccinations causes Strep A

Some posts and comments also imply that a study published in the scientific journal mBio is evidence that the nasal flu vaccine causes strep A infections.

The study found that the live attenuated flu vaccine (the type given to school children) increases the likelihood of finding two types of bacteria—including two strains of streptococcus pneumoniae—in the upper respiratory tract of mice.

However, this doesn’t mean that the nasal flu vaccine leaves children more susceptible to strep A infections—streptococcus pneumoniae and strep A are different types of bacteria.

Streptococcus pneumoniae is the name given to a group of more than 90 different strains of bacteria which can cause non-invasive infections such as bronchitis and sinusitis, as well as invasive infections such as pneumonia and meningitis. The study looked at two of these strains. It did not find any evidence of an increased risk of severe infection or death caused by streptococcus pneumoniae in mice given the vaccine.

The study also highlights that while flu vaccination with live attenuated vaccines “primes the upper respiratory tract for increased bacterial growth and persistence of bacterial carriage” in a very similar way to an actual flu virus infection [sometimes referred to as wild-type influenza], it doesn’t increase severe bacterial disease in the lower respiratory tract in the way an actual flu virus infection can.

Professor Clarke said: “When you get flu, often what kills you [...] is a bacterial infection further down in your lungs. So you don't get that with the vaccine, but you do with wild type flu.”

As well as being fun, this has been a great way of checking in with each other. Each piece of writing provides a different perspective on the pandemic. We’re delighted to share a selection of these with you.

Lesley O’Brien Week ending 3rd April 2020 Extract from ‘Supermarket Sweep’ ‘I don’t think you can freeze wine,’ says the woman next to me on her phone, frantically scanning the alcohol section in Tesco’s. I shake my head, bemused at the craziness the Corona virus has unearthed on humanity. I seem to have been lost in action in these aisles for a ridiculous amount of time. Having made the mistake of trying to do both my mum’s and my weekly shop simultaneously, I am suddenly further hindered by a chance meeting with an old neighbour (albeit her intention was good). She whispered that she had it from a good source, that as of 5pm tomorrow, we will be in ‘lock down’. ‘Well, at least, in London first, then moving here, to Scotland, shortly after,’ she assured me. Agh!! (cue high pitched screeching ‘Psycho’ strings in my head). I was now for sure, unable to do my usual, quick as a fiddler’s elbow, in and out of the aisles, weekly shop. The further implications of a ‘lockdown’ were yet to be considered. Faced with blank, empty shelves, staring at me, petulantly, daring me to buy something other than my mum’s usual carrot and potato, I stare at the lone asparagus, all that was left of the Greens section. She was not gonna like it. Asparagus? Asparagus! ‘AspAragus,’ as my mum had first pronounced it as a child. I now wander, like a lost child up and down the same aisles, several times. No tins of tomatoes, no pasta. ‘Tinned meat?’ I ask the assistant (my mum was getting a tin of corned beef, whether she had, ‘gone off it’ or not). He points me in the right direction and calls, ‘Good luck’, as if waving me off on some ill-fated voyage to the Antarctic. All around my fellow shoppers appear dazed, bomb shelled, like Stepford Wives, whose program has malfunctioned. The aim of their mission, deleted, as they wonder ziggety-zagetty across the Supermarket floor. At the cash desk, the cashier is wearing plastic gloves, she shows me how her Barbie pink pointy nails have pierced a hole. I tell her a joke, I saw on Facebook; man wearing a plastic collar, type usually worn by dogs after an operation, to stop them scratching. The dog is saying, ‘Noo, it’s fur yer ain good. Nae scratchin!’ I tell her, ‘My mum’s not gonna like the ‘no potatoes’ report’. As far as my mum’s concerned, a dinner without tatties, ‘Jist disnae bear thinking aboot’. The cashier whispers (whispering seems to have become a thing), ‘A woman yisterday, tried to buy twenty bags o potatoes and then another yin, thirty bottles o wine’. I recall having a wee joke with the same assistant, only a week ago, about the loo roll panic buying. I’d jested that we’d just have to cut up The Beano, the way my mum says she used to, during the war and smirked, ‘Only, it’ll be The Metro, we’ll be fighting over next’. A friend, in fact, later proudly posted a photo of her cyclamen pink face cloth, neatly cut into little strips, ready, present, and correct for re-cycling duty.

Melody House Week ending 17th April 2020 This week marks one month exactly since I was last in the library. It has not been an easy month. The most difficult part is trying to get used to the uncertainty. Naturally, there is so much uncertainty at this time. As a higher risk person, I have had to get used to a new and growing anxiety about leaving my home. I used to live in a country where this was a normal feeling. I never felt secure when I had to venture outside, and I was constantly looking over my shoulder, expecting the worst, even if it never came. I have had to deal with the return of these unwanted feelings. Finding excuses not to leave. Getting ready, and then backing out at the last minute. Putting it off, until I realise, I haven’t been outside for over a week. There is the added stress of financial uncertainty. It is possibly one of the worst moments in modern history to be unemployed. Searching for jobs is impossible. The ones that are available require you to work in public spaces, putting yourself at risk of catching the virus. The ones that are home based, are generally called off at the last minute, because companies and organisations are also dealing with uncertainties and are unable to hire new employees at this time. It is difficult for these companies to pay existing employees, especially if they have been forced to close down and have no way of making any money. It can be so easy to let the uncertainty creep in and slowly eat away at you. But what has helped me through this time is hope. I have hope that we will come out of this changed for the better. I have hope that we will realise all the shortcomings in our society and hold our politicians to correcting them. I have hope that we will look at our friends and family in a new light and appreciate them more. I have hope that we will look at our leaders and pay close attention to the ones who have fought for us, and the ones who have not, and remember that for our next vote. I have hope for us. I have hope for our future. And that is all we need. Rebecca Solnit says, ‘To hope is to give yourself to the future – and commitment to the future is what makes the present inhabitable.’ We will see the light again, and for now, at least we have the rainbows.

Anabel Marsh Week ending 15th May This week I have been catching up with online book events! The Virtual Literary Festival site put on a Big Book Weekend which featured talks from the many festivals which have been cancelled in the last few months. I particularly liked Mairi Kidd’s interview with Bernardine Evaristo, and not just because it was the contribution from Glasgow’s very own Aye Write. Bernardine won the Booker Prize last year for Girl, Woman, Other which I read a few months ago and absolutely loved. It has 12 main characters who each have their own chapter, but as you read you begin to see the connections between them. I used GWL’s copy, sadly not currently accessible, but if you can get hold of the book by other means I recommend that you do so. The talks are all still online at myVLF.com if you fancy a look. Other authors I listened to included Marian Keyes and AL Kennedy, and still on my list are Jackie Kay, Maggie O’Farrell, Juno Dawson and others. One of the organisers of the Big Book Weekend was Kit de Waal whose writing I also enjoy – try My name is Leon. I also caught up with Sara Sheridan’s talk ‘Where are the women’ via the National Galleries of Scotland site. In her book of the same name, Sara reimagines Scotland as if all the streets and monuments named after men were named after women. I particularly like that she chose to call one of the paths in Kelvingrove Park “Stephen Way” after Suffragette Jessie Stephen, my favourite woman on our GWL walks. Unfortunately, Sara’s book is also locked away in GWL but I hope someday soon we can all consult it again. Finally, I’m still collecting pictures of rainbows and other window decorations on my daily walks. I thought this one was appropriate for GWL – together we can!

Anna Forrest Week ending 15th May 2020 This week started out funny, mostly it takes until Wednesdays but Monday was not its usual serious self. Drama Queens by Zoom is just funny, even if we were not working on a script, the things these clever and creative women bring in is phenomenal. This week I have surprised myself. I have done things that I would never have considered doing, and spoken to people I would never have dared speak to before. I have learned a few things which might address the balance for the many things I have forgotten. And here I am putting pen to iPad and ranting. Surprised myself: Emailed an MSP, Adam Tompkins, when I read (Times Scotland) conflicting reportage about whether weddings were to be allowed to take place in Scotland, with reduced numbers of guests. However Registrars in Scotland are still unable to grant licences unless under extremely special circumstances. So, how does this work? Actually admitting I put my legal qualifications after my name, lawyers take other lawyers seriously, even if they are numpties. Done things I would not have done before: Cooked vegetarian food for a whole week including the weekend. We survived.

Set up a Zoom Family Group as host, our son is now producing a Family Murder Mystery, and our daughter-in-law is formatting a children’s book where we each write a chapter based on the bizarre life of our black cat Gizmo who was a local celebrity as she rode the local Cathcart Circle trains, and often turned up for hockey games at Hutchison Grammar’s playing ground.

Finally finished a cross-stitch Tree of Life for our daughter’s marriage, whenever that happens. It has taken 6 weeks and given me a dowagers hump.

Made a list of friends that I have not seen or spoken to in 6 months and phoned, WhatsApp video called, FaceTimed or just turned up at their houses and spoke through windows, porches or closes. I have learned: How to with circular knitting needles and double pointed needles, now I know why there are five.

Never to knit with alpaca hand spun yarn, it breaks off into wispy ends and has to be knotted, frequently.

How to fall and get back up safely, courtesy of a friend and a YouTube video. I was knocked over by a cyclist in Pollok Country Park, he/she failed to stop but had the smeddum* to call me an old tart! I didn’t mind the tart bit but old is not me. So I needed to learn to fall over and get up faster so that in future I could give chase to fascists.

I have learned to listen more and speak less, enough said. I have learned to scream and swear silently when doing Pilates by Zoom unsure whether I’m muted, hoping that the uber-lithe Odile cannot lip read from a distance, I may consider a mask. * smeddum – old Scots word for cheek, brass neck, swagger

Olive Week ending 24th April 2020 This week I have been keeping calm and flexible with daily Zoom yoga from the wonderful Yoga Healing Glasgow studio teachers. I’ve also been sending home-made face masks to family and friends. I’m grateful for my balcony from where I can chat to my neighbours, watch the birds on and around the Clyde and soak up the spring sunshine.

Sarah Hill Week ending 22nd May Written for a Mass Observation diary day on 12 of May Extracts from ‘Clootie Dumpling’ Today, 12 May 2020, would have been my grampa’s 97th birthday and it is the first of his birthday’s without him. He died on Friday 16 August last year after a decline in health from the end of the preceding May. On this day last year, we visited him as a family: my mum, my aunt and uncle, two of my cousins and their husbands, with their three children between them, the smallest only three months old on her first visit to meet her great-grampa.[ . . . ] Today, I woke up and scrolled through photographs on my phone looking for pictures of him. There are a couple of pictures of old photographs from when we cleared out his house. He is on holiday, in polyester polo shirts, in his sixties, already retired, already a grampa but still young. A series of blurry snaps of him chatting to me, that he didn’t know I was taking. Him looking through the newspaper, in the hospital, even though he had had a stroke and could no longer really read; the last picture I took of him.[ . . . ] I am working from home during the coronavirus pandemic but I have taken the day off. At the beginning of this year, I thought I would spend today with my mum, aunt and cousin, sorting through the box of old photo from my grampa’s house. My mum is a key worker and still travels to work each day which is not too far from where I live. I’ll take a walk to briefly see her today for the first time in the eight weeks since restrictions began. [ . . . ] The main task of the day is to make a clootie dumpling—a Scottish, sweet, fruit cake. It is a family custom that my grampa, and my gran when she was alive, make a dumpling for you on your birthday. He did this for all his children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren every birthday (whether they liked it or not) and still made one for my birthday last May just before he became unwell.[ . . . ] Grief has crept up on me again. After a death you have some compassionate leave but after that time you force yourself into old routines which don’t leave much room for the reflection and contemplation and space and time that useful, satisfying grief requires. I wanted more time, but I was able to do without, so I went back to normal. Now with much more time alone, I find myself tearful at my desk as I work. [ . . . ] My mum and I were at the hospital when he died. We stayed there for the second night in a row. Eleven weeks earlier he had a fall and went into hospital. Two weeks after that he had a stroke—the only Saturday he didn’t get his bet on. He never properly regained his speech after this but learned to walk with help and we walked to the social room to watch the racing on Saturdays.[ . . . ] I hope we all take time to grieve and reflect now, for the world, for those who’ve died and those who are suffering. I hope we don’t force ourselves back to normal. I hope we keep up the compassion and patience we have learned for friends, colleague and strangers. I hope we have learned we don’t need to burn fuel or money or time. I hope we have realised that we have the power to change things instantly, when we want to, when we unite with one shared goal. Once the dumpling is ready, I will dry it by the fire, warming the room with cinnamon smells. I’ll cut some slices and take them to my mum. We won’t hug or talk for long – we shouldn’t be meeting. But I’ll see her and we’ll both remember him today by eating clootie dumpling and chips, and by going on. One minute left and it’ll be ready. Right.

Becky Male Week ending 12th June 2020 I’ve just finished my hundredth mask. Making things has, for a long time, been my refuge: when my hands are busy, my mind is quiet. People who don’t craft often react with wonder at the things I make, like I’ve conjured aether into art. It doesn’t feel like magic, not when my hands are littered with nicks and small iron burns. My right hand has new callouses from gripping the sewing machine wheel over and over. Maybe there is a magic in this act but it’s not in the creation; the true magic is in the disappearance. Once a week someone comes to my door and takes the masks away. I leave them in a basket on my doorstep, I never even see them go, never see the person who takes them away, our only interaction is when I buzz them into my close. When they’re gone, the only evidence of their existence is the empty spools and blunt needles that litter my desk. A quarter of my masks have gone to family and friends, some of those whisked away by the Royal Mail hundreds of miles from Glasgow. Others, I cycled around the city myself, leaving in boxes, bags, whatever vessel is safest for the receivers. I’ve made a point of not asking for anything in return – profiting from this would feel perverse. They’re mostly made from scraps of fabric from my stash: leftovers, old clothes, remnants I bought long ago because I liked the pattern but had no immediate use for. So far, all I’ve had to spend money on is white thread and elastic. All I’ve asked from friends who receive masks is that they pay it forward in some way. Masks sent to London and Manchester both resulted in donations to their local food banks. Friends with a car brought me a bag of compost. Another gave me a large box of teabags, oat milk and soap. One of my friends decided the best way to pay it forward was to cover what expenses I have incurred and transferred me twenty pounds. I now have a growing collection of thank you cards which one friend jokingly described as “trophies of your objective goodness”. The rest of my masks are donated to a group called ‘Angelic Threads 2020’. When they appeared on Facebook, knowing that I’d made masks for myself, at least three friends tagged me or sent me their details. It’s nothing as formal as a charity, just a group of volunteers organised by one woman – who I suspect is probably paying for things like elastic out of pocket – run through the internet, text message and phone call. Fabric, donated by those who can’t sew but want to help, gets dropped off to volunteers to make more. [ . . . ] Isopropyl alcohol has become my best friend during this, even if it does make my flat smell like cheap vodka. My tools, machine, drying rack, everything that comes into contact with the masks gets spritzed in it. Like the vinyl gloves I wear to handle the sanitised masks, it was something I thankfully already owned – the alcohol for doing my nails, the gloves for everything from hair dying to spray painting to kneading dough without wrecking my fresh manicure. Perhaps not things every household would have to hand but things that quickly went out of stock early in the pandemic. Each mask is five pieces of fabric, sixteen inches of elastic and a five inch piece of wire. My first set of pattern pieces disintegrated from overuse. My second set is already heading that way. I’ve still got plenty of usable fabric, the need to stay busy and the time to make more. We don’t know how long masks will be needed but we know that overwhelmingly women will be the ones filling that need, because in times of crisis that’s what we do.

Jo Beth Gray Week ending 5th June 2020 In response to the horrific news of another man dying because of his skin colour and police brutality, and the riots that sparked fires and protests, I have tried to make an attempt at capturing some of the feeling. I found it very challenging, but I tried to speak from the heart. George Floyd Disliked, by minority pink people? The majority who, are colour blind? Not innocuous, red, and green, But obnoxious, black, and white. Rigid thinkers, in tight blue uniform, declaring their way, or no way. Seeing red because you’re brown, no respect if you’re in town. No excuse, needed to bully, No reason, needed to restrain, No apology, needed for killing, George, black, and blue and in pain. This disdain for life isn’t yellowing. We’re fed up with brazen lies. We want justice. And a reddening of cheeks, under enlightened eyes. We want the whole force, of the law, to bow on one knee, admitting this is not the way, to treat equals, in the land of the free. We want Floyd to die a hero. His final breath making it clear. That the colour of your face doesn’t determine your value here. The law needs to be transparent. No fear in black communities. Knowing every life is deserving of respect, of love, of opportunities. I’m so sorry of your death And the many lives before you. Please forgive me for standing by, White flags everywhere, need raising high. This racism must end. It starts with you… and stops with me."

If your eggs, sperm or embryos are not used immediately in treatment, you may wish to store your eggs, sperm or embryos so they can be used for treatment in the future.
To be stored eggs, sperm or embryos are frozen.
On 1 July 2022, the rules on how long you can store eggs, sperm or embryos changed.
Before 1 July 2022, most people could normally only store their eggs, sperm or embryos for up to 10 years.","stored, nonbinary, treatment, embryos, sperm, seeking, trans, need, storage, fertility, eggs, clinic, consent, information, store","How long can I store my eggs, sperm, embryos or reproductive tissue for use in treatment?

If your eggs, sperm or embryos are not used immediately in treatment, you may wish to store your eggs, sperm or embryos so they can be used for treatment in the future. To be stored eggs, sperm or embryos are frozen. You will need to think about how far in the future you might want or be able to use stored eggs, sperm or embryos and the potential costs of storing. This is something you should discuss with your clinic.

You should be aware that embryos can only be stored if both you and the egg or sperm provider have given consent. This may be your partner or may be a donor (if donated eggs or sperm were used in treatment).

On 1 July 2022, the rules on how long you can store eggs, sperm or embryos changed. Before 1 July 2022, most people could normally only store their eggs, sperm or embryos for up to 10 years. Only if they had premature infertility or were going to be having medical treatment which could affect their fertility, could they store for up to 55 years.

The law now permits you to store eggs, sperm or embryos for use in treatment for any period up to a maximum of 55 years from the date that the eggs, sperm or embryos are first placed in storage. However, crucially for storage to lawfully continue you will need to renew your consent every 10 years. You can give your consent on the relevant consent form. You will be contacted by your clinic with relevant information and they should also provide you an offer of counselling before you give consent to storage of your embryos. Your clinic will contact you and provide the consent forms that you need to complete at the appropriate time. It is therefore essential that you keep your contact details up to date with your clinic as you will need to be contacted. If your clinic is unable to contact you your eggs, sperm or embryos will be at risk of being removed from storage and disposed of.

You don’t have to match the length of storage to any contract for paying for the storage (whether you, or the NHS, is paying). However, if you don’t pay for storage as agreed, the clinic may be within its right to dispose your eggs, sperm or embryos. Your clinic should have explained this to your clearly when you stored yours, sperm or embryos."

Having cancer can make us to think about the bigger things in life, and this may include searching for meaning, questioning or being angry.

You may be looking for spiritual support. This can be from family and friends, your local community, a hospital chaplain or other religious leader.

Other ways of connecting with your spirituality include music, nature, poetry, art, meditation and mindfulness.

Living with cancer can sometimes raise big questions, and we may rely on a number of coping strategies. Whilst formal religion has declined over recent years many people still turn to spiritual support at a time of crisis.

Put simply, religion is an organised set of beliefs and practices a group of people follow, based on divinity and faith. There are many different religions. Meanwhile, spirituality is the sense of being part of something greater than ourselves, giving meaning and purpose in our lives.

Many people have spiritual needs. These are influenced by personal values, beliefs and relationships. You may find you have questions, be angry with, or draw closer to a faith or spiritual support system. This could be particularly with end of life issues, but can happen during any part of living with cancer.

Nurses and doctors, especially in cancer and palliative care, (but in caring situations generally) aim to be sensitive to spiritual needs and distress. Religion can be a very personal topic, and so if it is important to you, please let your healthcare teams know.

Sometimes, anxiety and depression can be partly due to spiritual questions and a search for meaning. Here are some ways to recognise spiritual needs, and how to address them.

Finding ways to cope spiritually

If your faith is important to you or you would like to draw closer to the religious part of spirituality, you could visit your local church or religious centre. Being part of something organised and spiritually uplifting can help at a time of crisis.

You can connect with your spirituality through the arts, meditation, nature, personal reflection and talking with others. Exploring new hobbies, finding ways to express yourself, and connecting with others can help give meaning and purpose.

Practice or develop new skills that help with relaxation, mindfulness, and creative therapies. Visit your local Maggie’s centre, for example, and find out what is available, in terms of relaxation, therapies, support and a sense of community.

Talk with someone who can identify your spiritual needs. You may have big questions or be struggling with ‘why me?’ and ‘why now? This may be through your place of worship, the hospital chaplain, or religious leader. These could be questions you feel able to ask your healthcare team, or at Maggie's.

Recognise that the thoughts, feelings and emotions you’re experiencing are likely to be a mixture of psychological and spiritual issues. The sources of support you access for one can often overlap. Talking about how you feel, with people who understand, can help you feel heard and less isolated.

Many people with cancer, when asked about what is important to them, said that family and friends gave their life meaning. Making time for those close to you, and valuing quality time with people you love, can often seem more important when living with cancer.

When to seek further help

If you’re finding that thoughts, feelings and emotions are making you worried, and low in mood - talk to someone. The issues you face may have a spiritual component, but your doctor will be able to recognise what is normal for you - and whether you are becoming depressed or need further help.

If you’re angry, or are struggling with your faith and spirituality, it can help to talk with a local chaplain, church or religious leader. Hospital and hospice chaplains recognise spiritual distress, and aim to listen, whichever faith they belong to.

Visit your local Maggie’s and talk with others who will understand that you are struggling - recognising that cancer has raised big questions for you.

What now?

Read through our links and blogs on this page to find out more about managing spiritual distress, and building up your emotional resilience.

Visit your local Maggie’s centre, where you can meet others who understand what you’re going through, and share your story."

Having a terminal illness can make you think about death, dying, and the meaning of life. It can also make you think more deeply about your beliefs.

You might feel like:

you're struggling to find meaning and purpose in life.

it's harder for you to find hope, peace, and comfort.

you're lacking a sense of belonging or connection.

you're questioning the things you used to believe were true.

This can leave you feeling lost, anxious or distressed.

It's common to feel like this when you have a terminal illness. So try to be kind to yourself if you are feeling this way. Being diagnosed with a terminal illness will mean a huge change to your life, so it's likely you'll feel lots of different emotions.

If you're feeling lost, or like you're lacking purpose, you might find this makes your physical symptoms worse. In a similar way, physical pain and symptoms can make you feel worse emotionally and mentally.

If you're worried about your mood or your feelings, there's support available. Read more about the support you could get below.

Losing faith

For some people, their sense of faith becomes more important to them when they're ill, and they find it a great support.

For others, being diagnosed with a terminal illness makes them start questioning their faith, or the things they once believed.

Whether you're religious or not, you can still lose faith. Losing faith might mean:

no longer believing in values you used to live by

not wanting to do the things that usually bring you joy or peace

not seeing the purpose or meaning of anything

no longer believing in your religion, or questioning parts of your religion

asking questions like ""where is God now?"" and ""why is God allowing me to suffer?""

This is really hard to deal with. But if you do feel like this, know that there is support available and people you can talk to.

Your illness and your religion

If you follow a certain religion, your illness might mean you can't practise it in the way you're used to. For example, you might not be able to attend religious services or take part in rituals like fasting.

This might make you feel angry, frustrated, or like you've lost connection with your religion.

If you're feeling this way, speak to your religious leader. They might suggest other ways to stay connected with your religion.

You could also speak to a chaplain – read more about what they do below.

Coping with your feelings

If you're feeling lost, or you find yourself questioning your beliefs, this can seem overwhelming. Below is a list of things which might help you feel more in control over how you're feeling:

Give yourself time to think.

Do things which normally give you a sense of hope – this is personal and could be anything from praying to going for a walk.

Think about any unresolved issues you have and consider whether you'd like to resolve or talk about them.

Try to make the time to prepare for and think about death. You could create an advance care plan.

Talk about your feelings with someone you feel comfortable with.

If you're religious, do something which helps you feel connected with your faith. This could be praying or speaking to your religious leader.

Make a list of values and beliefs that are important to you, and think of times when you've lived by these.

Make a list of things you enjoy doing – even if you don't feel up to them now, just writing them down and remembering happy times might help.

Write in a diary about what you're thinking or feeling.

Make a memory box and fill it with mementos, photographs, or things which remind you of times in your life.

Try a complementary therapy.

Try a talking therapy, like cognitive behavioural therapy.

Do something for someone else, if you feel up to it – some people find helping others improves their self-esteem.

People who are ill sometimes worry about being a burden to others, so they focus on other people's feelings. It can be difficult, but try to look after yourself. Finding ways to cope with your feelings can make a big difference to your sense of control and purpose.

Getting support

Palliative care isn't just about treating your illness or symptoms – it also includes emotional, spiritual and psychological support. The support you receive should suit your needs, beliefs and values.

Talking to others

Talking about how you feel and trying to answer some of the difficult questions you're having may help. Talking can help you:

be kinder to yourself

rekindle relationships with the people important to you

think and reflect upon your life

reconnect with values, beliefs and talents you may have forgotten

understand more about who you are.

Below are some people you could talk to.

Those important to you

You might feel comfortable speaking with the people close to you about your feelings. You could ask them to listen to you and help you talk through things. This could be family members, friends, a partner, or anyone else important in your life.

Read more about getting support from those around you.

Chaplains and faith leaders

Chaplains, spiritual co-ordinators and faith leaders can offer support whether you're religious or not. They're often based in hospitals or hospices. Ask someone from your healthcare team to put you in touch. You could also speak to your own faith leader or a non-religious leader.

Non-religious support

Humanist Care has a network of trained volunteers who provide support to everyone, regardless of their religion or belief. Find out more about Humanist Care.

Health and social care professionals

You can talk about what you're going through with someone you're not as close to, like your doctor, nurse, social worker, or someone else from your healthcare team.

If you don't want to talk

Not everyone finds talking about their feelings helpful. Some people feeling low or anxious find it hard to talk to the people they're close to. And sometimes, people try to appear cheerful even though they're having difficult emotions.

If you don't want to talk, that's OK. Here are some things to try instead:

Activities which don't involve speaking to others about your feelings. For example, art therapy, meditation, or relaxation.

Give yourself time to process. If you don't feel like talking now, you might in the future.

Let those around you know that you don't want to talk. Ask them to respect your decision and let them know they're still important to you.

Speak to someone you don't know as well. This could be a professional, like a counsellor or psychologist.

Speaking to a psychologist or counsellor

You could talk to a psychologist or counsellor. They can provide different types of therapy, which can help you to cope with difficult thoughts and feelings, and find ways to manage them.

Speak to your doctor or nurse about what counselling services are available in your area. They may also be able to help you if you're feeling depressed or anxious. Read more about depression and anxiety.

Find free counselling services on the NHS.

Find counselling services which you pay for (private counselling).

Art and music therapy

Art or music therapy can help you express your thoughts and feelings. In art therapy, you create pictures or objects that have personal meanings. In music therapy, you can play an instrument, listen to music, or sing. You can have art or music therapy with a therapist, in a group, or on your own. It's free in some hospitals, hospices and care homes. Ask your doctor or nurse if it's available where you are.

Find a qualified art therapist.

Find a qualified music therapist.

Support groups

Many people find it reassuring to talk to others who are in a similar situation. Whether you'd prefer to talk to someone face to face or online, there are people out there who can share how they cope. Ask your doctor or nurse about local support groups.

Online support groups

Lots of charities have online communities, including Marie Curie's online community, where you can share your experiences in a safe environment with people who understand.

Macmillan Cancer Support's community has a specific discussion forum for atheists, agnostics and non-religious people affected by cancer.

Visit Marie Curie's community.

About maternal mental health

As many as one in five women develop a mental illness during pregnancy or in the first year after birth. Suicide is a leading cause of maternal deaths in the UK within a year after childbirth.

Despite this, pregnant women and new mothers have no access to specialist community perinatal mental health services in almost half of the UK.

In some parts of the UK, such as Hartlepool and Uttoxeter, the natural level is already at one part per million. In parts of Essex, for example, the natural fluoride in water approaches one part per million and, even if slightly below this level, is high enough to make a difference to oral health.

Fluoridation is a tried and tested method of replicating the dental benefits that naturally fluoridated water at the 1 ppm concentration provides. The answer is dental caries, which is one of the commonest diseases in terms of the numbers of people affected. Children are particularly vulnerable. Despite reductions in prevalence over the past 40 years, dental caries remains a major public health problem.

Given that there is evidence to show that fluoridation does reduce tooth decay, and given that the benefits tend to be greatest among socially deprived children suffering the highest levels of decay, is there not an ethical imperative on those of us concerned about the public health to take action?

And should not those who perhaps have a personal preference to drink non-fluoridated water set aside that preference so that others less fortunate than themselves, especially children, can benefit?"

Menstrual health reflects general health

Dr Karen Morton, consultant gynaecologist for Dr Morton's - the medical helpline, says that the regularity of periods is a key indicator for overall well-being.

""Having regular periods is generally a sign of good general health. Being too thin or too fat will often stop regular egg production because nature decides that the woman is not in the right physical condition to be pregnant and nurture a baby.""

The regularity of your period, or losing it altogether, can indicate a reproductive condition such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), an eating disorder or even wider health issues such as stress. Many apps also offer the ability to monitor exercise and water intake as well as recording your cycle, which may contribute to a healthier lifestyle.

It can help you understand your cycle

By tracking your period, and particularly by tracking your flow and discharge, you can understand the way in which your menstrual cycle works. This can allow you to be more in tune with your body, recognise fluctuations and be prepared throughout the month.

Chief executive of gynaecological cancer charity The Eve Appeal, Athena Lamnisos, explains, ""Knowing your menstrual cycle is a very important part of knowing your normal. Keeping track of your periods, when they are, how long and how heavy, will allow you to spot if anything changes for you, which could be a symptom of many things. Occasionally this even includes cancer, which of course you want to rule out.""

However, her advice isn't just for people who are still menstruating. ""If you aren't having periods anymore, it's recognising that any amount of bleeding is never 'normal' and needs to be checked out.""

Tracking can also help you understand other variations throughout the month. Mood swings can feel random and frustrating at times, but by recording your cycle you may be able to understand your mood. This can enable you to take action if it becomes a problem. Recording mood symptoms can be particularly helpful for those concerned about, or living with, a more severe form of PMS called premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), as a period tracker can reflect exactly when symptoms appear. This goes for all emotional and physical symptoms.

You can track abnormal symptoms

The Eve Appeal suggests using period tracking apps or a diary to record symptoms such as irregular periods, pain, heavy bleeding and spotting, as well as abnormal discharge. Lamnisos says: ""If you are concerned about any changes you are experiencing - including bleeding between periods or after sex - tracking this will equip you with the information you need to have a meaningful conversation with your doctor.""

Lydia Brain was 24 when she was diagnosed with womb cancer after two to three years of going to GPs with abnormal bleeding. ""My periods got heavier so gradually that it was hard to pick up when they were abnormal,"" she explains.

Following diagnosis, she required a full hysterectomy as one of her two tumours was deep in the wall of her womb. Now 26, she notes, ""I wish I had tracked my periods properly, as perhaps I would have got diagnosed sooner if I could have demonstrated more evidence to the doctor that something abnormal was going on.""

Monitor your fertility and plan ahead

For those wishing to get pregnant, and those trying to avoid pregnancy, understanding your cycle enables you to plan ahead. Many apps will predict your 'fertile window' as well as a day of ovulation so you can avoid or aim to have sex at the most appropriate time. But the majority of period tracker apps aren't certified for use as contraception. And experts don't advise using any of them as your only form of birth control. It's a good idea to use other contraceptive methods as well as natural family planning when trying to avoid pregnancy.

You can also plan ahead for your period, which may be beneficial to those going on holiday, taking exams or participating in sport. It is possible to delay a period by starting the contraceptive pill or taking a hormone tablet called norethisterone on an occasional basis for special events. This is available on prescription from your GP. Alternatively, many pharmacists are qualified to offer a private service offering norethisterone to delay your period and you can access this service from qualified community pharmacists without waiting for a GP appointment.

Help your doctor help you

As part of their Get Lippy campaign during May 2019, the Eve Appeal issued advice for getting the most out of your GP appointments, with 'knowing your cycle' and 'being prepared' taking the number one spot. Period tracking also helps you to be able to communicate symptoms to your doctor accurately, including small details which you may have otherwise forgotten.

""Most women can give an accurate story of what their periods are like and when they come,"" says Morton. But she still notes the usefulness of tracking. ""Sometimes recording personal data such as on a menstrual app can empower women to talk openly and confidently about a problem they have been worried about for a long time.""

As part of their 2020 campaign, The Eve Appeal has shared its tips on tracking your bleeding, whether from your regular period or abnormal or irregular bleeding throughout the month.

Some of the tips include: Taking note of how heavy your periods are, especially if they disrupt your daily activities, heavy bleeding lasts longer than 7 days or you need to change your tampon or pad every hour or so.

Noting down bleeding experienced during or after sex and any pain which came with it.

Noting down discharge which is pink, red or brown (bloody discharge).

Although most people who experience abnormal vaginal bleeding won't have cancer, it's still important to get anything which is abnormal for you checked out by a doctor or gynaecologist. During the pandemic you will usually have a telephone appointment before being seen in person."

This initiative sheds light on the vital role breastfeeding plays in nurturing the health and well-being of both these groups and is part of our Community Fund and support of the UN Global Compact.

For infants, the benefits of breastfeeding are multifaceted and remarkable. First and foremost, it acts as a powerful shield against ailments such as diarrhoea, ear infections, pneumonia, and asthma. Moreover, breastfeeding significantly reduces the likelihood of obesity and the development of allergies in infants. One of the most compelling advantages is the decreased risk of sudden infant death syndrome, illustrating the profound protective impact that breastfeeding can have on a child’s life.

How to access covid treatment in England

In England, if you test positive for covid-19 you will no longer automatically be contacted by the NHS to discuss treatment. The way you access assessment for covid treatments varies depending where you live. Use the drop-down menu below to find out what you should do in your area as soon as you test positive for covid. You should follow the instructions for your local Integrated Care Board (ICB) ­­– the area where you are registered with a GP. Find your local Integrated Care Board on the NHS website. If you are travelling within the UK and test positive for covid, contact NHS 111. In some areas, you can refer yourself for treatment. If this applies to you, make sure you have the following information to hand when you make contact with a Covid-19 Medicines Delivery Unit (CMDU) or a similar service: date you tested positive

date your symptoms started

current address (including where you’re staying if you’re away from home)

contactable phone number

your current medical conditions

your current medications Although you do not have to register your positive test (online or by 119) to access treatments, we still recommend you do this because it will mean your test result is visible to the NHS against your NHS number. Normal prescription costs apply for covid treatment in England. However, if you have blood cancer, you can get a Medical Exemption Certificate, which entitles you to free prescriptions. Find out more about free prescriptions.

Free covid tests in the UK

Make sure you keep a box of rapid lateral flow tests at home. Free testing is no longer available to the general public, but if you are eligible for covid treatments, you can still get free tests. You can also use tests you buy from a pharmacy. The results of these will be accepted. If you get covid symptoms, take a rapid lateral flow test as soon as possible. If it’s positive, follow the instructions for your country, or your local area if you live in England. If the test is negative, but you have covid symptoms, continue to take lateral flow tests daily.

Accessing free tests in England

From 6 November 2023, you should be able to pick up free rapid lateral flow tests from a local pharmacy. Tests now come in boxes of 5. When you visit your pharmacy, take a copy of a letter or email that shows you're eligible for covid treatments - this is not essential but will help confirm that you should have free tests. A friend, relative or carer can collect tests for you, or you may be able to book a volunteer responder by calling 0808 196 3646. Anyone collecting free tests for you should take a letter or email confirming your eligibility for covid treatments, plus these personal details: your condition or conditions

your NHS number

your full name

your date of birth

your address Some people have told us they are having difficulty getting free tests. You can check for pharmacies that offer free lateral flow tests by entering your location into this NHS pharmacy finder. You need to be eligible for covid treatments to get free tests.

Accessing free tests in Scotland

You can order free covid tests from the NHS Scotland portal.

Accessing free tests in Wales

In Wales, from 1 February 2024 you will be able to collect free tests from participating pharmacies. You will not be able to order tests online or by phone from this date. Use the NHS Wales online search to find a pharmacy near you providing free tests.

Accessing free tests in Northern Ireland

In Northern Ireland, you should be able to collect free lateral flow tests from your local pharmacy. It may help to take a letter or email showing that you are eligible for covid treatments. See the advice for England above.

Tips for getting fast treatment for covid

Make sure you have contact details for your hospital team's out of hours service, in case you test positive at the weekend or any time outside their normal working hours.

Keep a list of your medical conditions and all your medications handy - this will help you during any telephone assessments for covid treatment.

If you are having medical care for any other health condition in addition to blood cancer, speak to both your blood cancer specialist and your other specialist now. Make sure they both know that you might need their input quickly if you get covid and need antiviral or antibody treatments.

If you have problems asking for covid treatment, contact your Integrated Health Board in England, your Health Board in Scotland, your Health Board in Wales or your Trust in Northern Ireland.

More about the treatments

Across the UK, people with blood cancer aged 12 and above who test positive for covid may be eligible for: Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) (antiviral, tablets)

sotrovimab (antibody, intravenous drip), if Paxlovid is unsuitable. These medicines aim to stop covid becoming severe and to prevent hospitalisation or serious illness in those most at risk. After your positive test, you would need to have a telephone consultation with a healthcare professional, to find out whether you can have one of the treatments. These treatments are available across the UK, although the process for how to access them varies in the different countries - we explain the process for how to access them above. These treatments have been found to be safe and effective at reducing the risk of hospitalisation and death in people with blood cancer with covid. Which treatment you have (if any) will be based on a personal assessment with a qualified healthcare professional about the different benefits and risks. Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir and ritonavir) antiviral treatment (made up of nirmatrelvir and ritonavir)

taken as tablets at home

can be used in people aged 18+

88-89% relative risk reduction of hospitalisation or death

should be given within 5 days of covid symptoms starting, but this can be extended to 7 days if needed

more about Paxlovid There are lots of health conditions and other medicines that can interact with Paxlovid. With some, you shouldn’t take Paxlovid at all, with others, your doctor should consider this with you before making a decision. The drugs include some cancer drugs, immunosuppressants, painkillers, drugs for infections, blood clot prevention drugs, hormonal contraceptives, and other medicines. So any decision about starting Paxlovid would need to follow a discussion about your type of blood cancer, any other health issues and what other medication you are on. Sotrovimab (Xevudy) to use if Paxlovid is unsuitable

antibody treatment

given into a vein (intravenously), so you’d need to attend a medical clinic to have treatment

can be used in people aged 12+ who weigh at least 40kg

79% relative risk reduction of hospitalisation or death

should be given within 5 days of covid symptoms starting

more about sotrovimab If you are told you are not eligible for treatment Not everyone with blood cancer will be eligible for the treatment, even after a telephone consultation. In this case, you could think about joining the PANORAMIC trial. This trial gives you a 1 in 2 chance of getting Paxlovid (half the people on the trial get Paxlovid and half don’t). You can sign up to the PANORAMIC trial yourself if you have covid symptoms, a positive covid test, and you are aged 50 or over, or 18 to 49 with an underlying condition.

What if I want to travel or go on holiday?

If you are thinking of travelling away from home, do discuss this with your healthcare team or doctor first. Ask them: What do I need to think about before travelling?

What should I do if I test positive for covid while I'm away? Not everyone with blood cancer needs antivirals or antibody treatments for covid, but some do. For many people, covid can seem mild at first but then get worse. Before you go away, make sure you: Have all of your covid vaccinations, including the spring booster

Ask your healthcare team what you should do if you get covid while you are away

Have contact numbers for your healthcare team, including numbers for evenings and weekends

Take a recent clinic letter and any medication paperwork with you

Take lateral flow tests away with you, and test if you get symptoms

Get travel insurance if you can - Blood Cancer UK have teamed up with Staysure to provide travel insurance for people with blood cancer.

Ask your healthcare team for a letter to take with you, detailing your current diagnosis, treatment and condition overview, medication list, fitness to travel, and eligibility for covid treatment. If you get covid while you are away, tell your healthcare team straight away and get their advice. You can also check the policy for covid treatments in the country you are visiting by contacting their health authority. If you have a UK European Health Insurance Card (UK EHIC) that hasn’t expired yet, or a UK Global Health Insurance Card (UK GHIC), you can access the same medical treatments as residents of the country you are in. So if covid treatments like Paxlovid are available in the country you are in, and you would be eligible for it according to that country’s guidance, you might be able to access it there.

Who is eligible to be assessed for treatment?

From 13 June 2022 (updated March 2023), written guidance explains that the following people with blood cancer might be eligible for a telephone assessment for covid treatment following a positive covid test. People who: have any type of blood cancer (including chronic blood cancers, MPN and MDS) and have had cancer treatment within the last 12 months (aspirin is not a cancer treatment) - including people with CML who are in chronic phase molecular response, or on first or second line TKI treatment) (previously, these CML patients were excluded)

had a stem cell transplant in the last 12 months - either allogeneic (donor) or autologous (using your own stem cells)

have active graft vs host disease (GvHD) regardless of how long ago the transplant was

had CAR-T therapy in the last 24 months

anyone else with CMML, myelofibrosis (CMML and myelofibrosis were previously excluded), MDS, myeloma (not including MGUS), or a chronic B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder (eg CLL, hairy cell leukaemia, follicular lymphoma, SLL, marginal zone lymphomas, MALT lymphoma, Waldenström macroglobulinaemia), regardless of treatment

anyone who has been diagnosed with a mature T-cell malignancy (eg peripheral T-cell lymphomas, cutaneous T-cell lymphomas, T-cell prolymphocytic leukaemia, T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukaemia). This category was added in March 2023. People with other conditions like other cancers, kidney disease, liver disease and other underlying conditions are also eligible. We have explained the breakdown for blood cancer above, but you can see the latest guidance here. If you are told you are not eligible for an assessment, but you think you should be, contact your hospital team straight away. Your specialist doctor (haematologist) may be able to refer you. Always let your hospital team and GP know if you have blood cancer and test positive for covid. We've produced this document with the British Society for Haematology to aid understanding of the eligibility criteria at covid medicine delivery units around the UK. It was up to date as of July 2023:

I have a condition that's not mentioned in the list above - am I eligible?

There are some people that might not be eligible for the covid treatment, according to the list above. This includes: people who have CML, ET, PV AND who have not had any anti-cancer treatment in the last 12 months (aspirin doesn't count as a cancer treatment), no CAR-T therapy in the last 24 months, and no active graft vs host disease (GvHD). The full guidance on eligibility is available here. For people with these conditions, we think you might not be eligible for covid treatment. However, as this eligibility criteria has changed several times, it might still be worth contacting 111, your GP or your hospital team, to ask whether you should have a telephone assessment for the treatment. Whether you have been sent a letter about this or not, if you get covid symptoms, take a covid test as soon as possible. If you get a positive result, follow the instructions for your country above, to find out whether you should access covid treatment. The eligibility criteria is based on advice from experts about different levels of risk in different conditions. It is under constant review with experts (we are also influencing this by sharing our vaccine research) so it's possible the list could be expanded again, as it already has been changed more than once. If you are worried about your risk and access to the treatment, talk to your doctor or medical team, or contact us.

I think I'm eligible but I haven’t had a letter We know that letters and emails have gone out to people about this. But because of the way that letters have been sent out, often using automatic processes and imperfect NHS data, some people who are eligible might not have got a letter. If your blood cancer diagnosis was recent, you might not have a letter yet. The groups of people with blood cancer who are eligible has also been expanded recently, so more people can access the treatments, but not everyone has been sent a letter since the eligibility was widened. Even if you haven’t had a letter, the latest treatments can still be given in all four nations of the UK if you are eligible. If you are included in any of the groups above and you get covid symptoms, take a covid test as soon as possible. Read the instructions near the top of this page, where we explain the process for each country. What if I’m not sure about having covid treatment? Many people are keen to get started on covid treatment once it’s been recommended, because for them, it’s the best way to stop their symptoms getting worse and avoid hospitalisation. Others feel a bit nervous about taking the new treatments, especially if their symptoms are mild. It's understandable to have questions and be looking for some reassurance. Here are some suggestions to help you feel comfortable with the decision you may need to make: Report a positive test result online straight away and have the assessment if you’re eligible – you won’t be committing yourself to having the treatment, but you will find out which drug is recommended for you.

Find out more about the recommended treatment. You can start by reading the information on this page and following the links to the patient information leaflets.

Write down your questions or concerns and either go through them with someone from the telephone assessment team, or contact your hospital team. Most treatments need to start within five days of symptoms starting, so you may feel under a bit of pressure to make the decision. But do ask questions – NHS staff should be ready to answer them. Antibody and antiviral treatments are preventive – they are designed to stop the covid getting worse. So even if you feel well in the first couple of days, it’s possible that things could change. But the decision to have treatment is yours. If you’d like to talk through anything before you speak to a medical professional, contact our Support Service free on 0808 2080 888 or [email protected]. We can’t answer medical questions, but we can help you prepare for conversations about your health.

Evusheld (tixagevimab/cilgavimab) - for preventing covid in people with blood cancer

Evusheld is a preventative antibody treatment. It's designed to prevent covid in people who may not get effective protection from the covid vaccines. Evusheld is a long-acting antibody treatment, which was found to prevent covid in people who took it during trials in 2021. It's made by AstraZeneca and is made of two monoclonal antibodies called tixagevimab and cilgavimab. It's given by injection. When Evusheld was first licenced in March 2022, it was seen as an important option for people with blood cancer who may not respond well to the covid vaccines. Evusheld was licenced by the MHRA (the body that regulates medicines in the UK) - this means that legally, Evusheld is allowed to be used in the UK. Whether it is made available routinely on the NHS is a separate decision though, made by NICE (the body that reviews which medicines should be given on the NHS). In early 2023, NICE issued guidance that Evusheld cannot be recommended on the NHS for vulnerable adults to protect against covid-19, because there is no evidence of its clinical effectiveness against current variants (and those likely to be circulating in the next 6 months) in the UK. Evusheld had already been made available privately in the UK, and this remains the case. We have more information about accessing Evusheld privately, and things to consider. Outside of private access, Evusheld is not available on the NHS, and NICE does not currently recommend its use for preventing covid. NICE has made this decision because the latest evidence shows that Evusheld is unlikely to prevent infection with most of the variants circulating in the UK now and in the near future.

How do antibody and antiviral treatments work?

Antibody treatments for covid

An antibody treatment can give your body the covid antibodies it needs to fight the illness. The antibodies are injected straight into the bloodstream. They will stick to the surface of coronavirus and stop it getting inside our cells and making us ill. They also act as a distress signal, telling other cells to come and help destroy the virus. This is particularly important for people with blood cancer, whose immune systems may not be able to develop its own covid antibodies after vaccination. Sotrovimab (Xevudy) is an antibody treatment.

Antiviral treatments for covid

Antivirals work slightly differently from antibodies. They interfere with the way the coronavirus replicates and reproduces in our body. On their own, viruses can’t make more versions of themselves. What makes them effective, is their ability to enter our own cells and hijack a toolbox in our cells that allows them to increase their numbers. Antivirals stop this from happening, and the less virus there is in our body, the lower the risk of more severe illness. Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir and ritonavir) is an antiviral treatment.

What other research is happening for people with blood cancer?

Blood Cancer UK are funding and coordinating research into how covid is affecting people with blood cancer, and how well the covid vaccines are working. Together with other charities, we are investing £800k in vaccine efficacy research. We report on our own research findings, and findings from other key studies. Find out what we know so far about covid vaccine efficacy for people with different blood cancers.

A guest blog by Catherine Hale with Alison Allam, Victoria Clutton and Leonora Gunn.

The Covid-19 crisis has us all in shock. But it has also shone a light on our social exclusion as a group of disabled people, as well as our hopes for inclusion.

Like other disabled people, the predominant response of the chronic illness community to the pandemic is fear. Many of us have conditions or treatments that put us at greater risk from this virus. We are walking a tightrope between the need to self-isolate and our dependence on others, whether family or paid assistants for day to day life, who may transmit the disease. Uppermost on our minds is how to get hold of food and medicines, and what will happen to us if our caregivers get sick.

But beneath that there are some deeply conflicted emotions running through our online networks. We are collectively feeling a mixture of hope and hurt as we watch how the world responds to Covid-19. Here’s how Elis Elmo put it to a Facebook group:

As someone who has been at home in bed for just over 6 years, I’m having such a mix of emotions I don’t know how to deal with them to be honest. I mean it’s good – “Wow” – look how much stuff out there for people at home and how people are caring for mental health in those situations. But I’m also sad because it makes me realise how much I was (and still am) forgotten. It really was that easy for people to care, they just…didn’t.

With half the world in lockdown, young and healthy people are experiencing a kind of isolation they may never have known before. Many are taking to social media to broadcast their boredom, frustration and grief at cancelled plans. Anxiety and distress are a normal response to a global pandemic. They are also, it appears, a common response to isolation itself. The loss of face to face interaction, the stifling sense of confinement – this is not how we humans are hard-wired to exist.

As this excellent Twitter thread by Zara Bain explains, many of us have been housebound, or indeed bedbound, for years or decades. This is not necessarily because social care services have failed to support us to get out and about, but rather because of the intrinsic nature of what we have termed “energy impairment.” Our forthcoming report describes energy impairment as a debilitating mix of physical and cognitive impairment.

Research by the Chronic Illness Inclusion Project (CIIP) captured the experiences of people with energy limiting chronic illness. In our recent survey of over 2,300 people, social isolation and loneliness were rated as the biggest social problem they faced, over and above their health condition itself. Isolation was rated a bigger problem than poverty or discrimination. Almost half of respondents with energy limiting conditions reported a comorbid mental health problem.

Yet before Covid19, in the public imagination, our lives were one long Netflix binge under the duvet. Now that non-disabled people are suddenly faced with cabin fever what hits home for us is the complete lack of empathy for our predicament before it happened to them.

From Sarah Campbell on Facebook:

Pre Covid-19:

People to me: “You’re so lucky. I wish I could just stay at home/in bed all day”

Post Covid-19:

“OMG: I have to stay at home a WEEK? What am I going to do? I’m going crazy on day 2! Poor me! This is awful!”

We in the chronic illness community are veterans of #selfisolation #lockdown #quarantine or whatever hashtag you want to apply to the covid19 experience. We have honed the art of housebound existence and are keen to share our survival guides, and our nuggets of wisdom. Check our post Housebound by Victoria Clutton, or Inside, a guide by author Josie George.

In return we would like some validation of our experiences and some respect for our hard-won resilience to isolation. Perhaps more than anything, we would like the world to care.

Some of us who’ve been housebound for years are getting kind notes through the door from longstanding neighbours offering help, often people we’ve never even met in the flesh before. Suddenly there is the sense that belong to our communities, we are held in mind, we are all in it together, and we are there for each other. This spirit of solidarity can be a welcome balm from our usual state of exclusion and invisibility.

It also brings home how little people thought of us before.

We are gobsmacked by the explosion of online activity and connectivity springing up in response to isolation. Suddenly the world has woken up to the fact that studying, working and socialising from home via the Internet is possible. The technologies for remote access and participation are being harnessed in a wave of innovation and energy. Yet, pre- Covid19, when we asked for these things, they were too difficult; or we were being awkward. Perhaps it was too hard to believe that our symptoms and impairments really do confine us to this extent. And perhaps it was easier to think we were just anti-social, or too lazy to make the effort to go out.

The discussions we’ve had in the CIIP go like this:

Is anyone else finding all the virtual yoga classes, museum tours, artistic exhibitions, theatre, cinema, reading groups… (the list goes on and on), not to mention all the remote work, kind of bittersweet? It’s wonderful that they’re there now, but I have been told so many times that they weren’t possible. And the answer is, as I think many of us expected all along, that these things were possible. It’s just that we weren’t worth it.

How many birthday celebrations and just general *things* have I missed because accommodations couldn’t be made for me and remote attendance options weren’t allowed or weren’t thought of. I worry sometimes that I’m so used to the limits that I’ve had to learn to live with, that I don’t even see past them anymore.

The chronic illness community was born from the Internet. Digital and social media networks are what connect us to each other from our beds and sofas around the world. But the wider world has ignored us. So along with the wonder of new online possibilities, there is also the hurt of realise we could have been included, if only people had thought we were worth the trouble.

For now, then, the panic is uppermost, and the losses from Covid-19 to our families and our communities will be immeasurable. But, like others, we hope for a better world on the other side of Covid19. The legacy of this crisis must be that that society has a better understanding of the lives of those of us who will remain housebound after it’s over. We hope that the sense that we belong too, and that our lives matter, will linger. After everyone else has gone back to their workplaces and their bars, we hope they will still reach out and include us on skype, Zoom, because it’s really not that hard, or just ask if we need some shopping or fancy a chat.

Americans’ consumption of red meat is not dominated by any single food type, research has shown, offering potential opportunities to encourage consumers towards alternatives.

Analysis of consumer eating habits from recent nationwide surveys shows that unprocessed red meat was most popularly eaten in the form of burgers, non-minced beef and mixed meat dishes such as meatloaf and shepherd’s pie.

Cold meats, sausages and frankfurters, pizza, and bacon were the most widely eaten forms of processed meat.

The findings may inform efforts to encourage people towards alternatives to red meat. This would help reduce average intake, currently around 450g per adult each week, towards the recommended limit of 100g each week.

Regular habits

A team of researchers including scientists from the Global Academy of Agriculture and Food Security analysed data from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys from 2015/16 and 2017/18. They examined meat intake for 12-19 year-olds and adults of 20 and upwards.

Efforts to encourage people to eat less red meat could initially focus on meat-free alternatives to burgers and pizzas, sausages and hot dogs, and lunch meat sandwiches, the results suggest.

This might be supported through the development of plant-based sandwich meats and pepperoni, or greater uptake of other plant-based proteins such as beans or peanut butter.

Adolescents were found to consume most of their meat from burgers and pizzas purchased at fast-food outlets, which researchers suggest may offer an opportunity to switch to meat-free alternatives.

Many young people may be inspired to eat less meat by their interest in climate change, and lifestyle changes associated with entering adulthood may present a time to adopt new habits.

The study builds on previous research by the same team, showing the extent of red meat consumption across North America.

The ways in which Americans eat meat are quite diverse. While meat-centric foods like burgers are popular, we found that a lot of meat is actually consumed in mixed dishes like casserole or lasagne. This is exciting for behaviour and policy work because it means there are a lot of opportunities to promote healthier, more sustainable plant-based options into the diet beyond, for example, substitutes for a large cut of meat. Ms Sarah Frank PhD student, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill

Unlike dairy, for which more than 50 per cent of intake comes from just one food group – milk – red meat is highly variable. This means there are a lot more opportunities to promote alternatives to red meat. But we need to be careful and closely monitor these alternatives to make sure environmental gains are not traded at the cost of public health, for example, by substituting in peanut butter with added sugar.

What about personal choice?

The pro-euthanasia and assisted suicide lobby emphasise the importance of personal choice and autonomy. Shouldn’t patients have the right to end their lives? Dignity in Dying patron, Sir Patrick Stewart has argued “We have no control over how we arrive in the world but at the end of life we should have control over how we leave it.”

Surely however the debate is not about the right to die; it is about the right to help patients kill themselves. Instead of giving freedom to patients, euthanasia and assisted suicide is about giving other people the legal power to end another person’s life.

Assisted suicide is not a private act. Nobody chooses assisted suicide in isolation. Euthanasia and assisted suicide are matters of public concern because they involve one person facilitating the death of another. Friends, relatives, healthcare staff and society are hugely affected by the wider ramifications of the process.

Journalist and author George Pitcher has said that any change in the law would have “profound adverse affects on the social fabric of our society, on our attitudes towards each other’s deaths and illnesses, on our attitudes towards those who are ill and have disabilities.”

Increased autonomy would apply only if you met all the criteria to be eligible. If you had a disease where the prognosis is not straightforward, dementia or a chronic but not terminal disease, then you would not meet the criteria; attempts to extend the law further would be almost inevitable. Assisted suicide is not a private act and there is a real risk that a ‘right to die’ may soon become a ‘duty to die’.

What about compassion?



The pro-euthanasia and assisted suicide lobby will often present the view that helping someone else to end their life is the most loving and compassionate thing to do. But surely the most compassionate thing to do is to care for a person at the end of their life and to show them that their life has tremendous value regardless of age or abilities.

Palliative care is an area of healthcare that focuses on relieving and preventing the suffering of patients. Britain is the only country in the world where palliative care is a recognised medical specialism. Further, in a recent survey by The Economist Britain was ranked first in the world for quality end-of-life care. The survey took in 40 OECD and non-OECD countries, including the USA, the Netherlands, Germany and France.

What about the most vulnerable?



Changing the law to allow euthanasia or assisted suicide will inevitably put pressure on vulnerable people to end their lives for fear of being a financial, emotional or care burden upon others. This would especially affect people who are disabled, elderly, sick or depressed. Some would face the added risk of coercion by others who might stand to gain from their deaths. Fear and anxiety would be promoted rather than Individual autonomy.

In its 1994 report The House of Lords Select Committee on Medical Ethics concluded:

“It was virtually impossible to ensure that all acts of euthanasia were truly voluntary and that any liberalisation of the law in the United Kingdom could not be abused. We were also concerned that vulnerable people – the elderly, lonely, sick or distressed – would feel pressure, whether real or imagined, to request early death.”

The law must protect the most vulnerable people in society. We must never let the depressed, the confused, those in terrible pain, the aged and the vulnerable feel that they should pursue the path of assisted suicide so as not to be a burden on others.

Dr Andrew Fergusson, of the Care Not Killing Alliance, has said “the simple truth is that the current law exists to protect those without a voice: the disabled, terminally ill and elderly, who might otherwise feel pressured into ending their lives”.

What next?



Studies concerning the euthanasia and assisted suicide law in countries that have legalised such measures make for troubling reading.

A study conducted in 2012 shows that 32% of the assisted deaths in Belgium are carried out without request and 47% of assisted deaths go unreported in the Flanders region of Belgium. Another recent study found that nurses are regularly euthanasing their patients in Belgium even though the laws prohibits it. Since euthanasia was legalised in 2002 there has not been one attempt to prosecute for abuses of the euthanasia law. In addition to this the study shows there was a 25% increase in the number of assisted deaths in Belgium in 2012.

In Oregon (where assisted suicide was legalised in 1997) the law has led to patients ‘doctor shopping’ for willing practitioners, using doctors who have minimal knowledge of their past. In 2008, 50 per cent of patients requesting suicide were assisted to die by a doctor who had been their physician for eight weeks or less.

Not all people who are terminally ill wish to end their life.



There have been tragic cases of people suffering terminable illness who want other people to help them end their life. It is important however that we do not lose sight of the large number of people who are terminally ill and have found richness and purpose in life despite the pain and hardship.

A survey published by the British Medical Journal in 2011 found that the majority of patients who are almost completely paralysed but fully conscious have said they are happy and do not want to die. The survey questioned 168 members of the French Association for Locked-in Syndrome.

Matthew Hampson was a promising young rugby player until a collapsing scrum left him paralysed from the neck down and requiring a ventilator to breathe. Matt divides his time between raising money for spinal care for UK charity Spinal Research, coaching youngsters at local schools and writing columns for rugby magazines. He has also written an autobiography. The Matt Hampson Foundation provides help, advice and for young people seriously injured through sport.

All life has profound human value.



We have to make clear that the value of life should not be determined by its benefit to others, or what it can contribute to society. The French biologist and philosopher Jean Rostand once said: “For my part I believe that there is no life so degraded, debased, deteriorated, or impoverished that it does not deserve respect and is not worth defending with zeal and conviction.”"

Without giving away too much I’ll just say, it’s time to try again, be brave, and be myself, and take some steps forward.
Okay – about that run!
And then maybe Netflix later 🙂My message is, if there is one, to not give up.","netflix, run, ill, speak, morning, know, try, steps, wellbeing, web, okay, help, leeds","I have mixed feelings about January 2022, there’s the old me thinking about getting fit, losing some weight, and becoming the healthiest version of myself. A cheery and ‘go-for-it’ kind of inner voice, which I wouldn’t want to be without. I’ve started Dry January and I know I’ll stick to it. My wine, chocolate, and Netflix consumption over the festive period had become a cocktail of anesthesia, and I know it’s time to turn the page and take tentative steps into the new year.

But there is a less robust part of me too, the one which woke up this morning after fitful sleep, shaky and unsure of my future and not entirely sure of myself, faced with the glaring onset of a New Year. I haven’t left the house today so far, and have missed that lovely window of morning sunshine, perfect for a new year’s run. But I am managing to be kind to myself, after all, I am tired.

After almost two years of a Pandemic, I’ve been lucky in that I didn’t fall seriously ill with Covid or develop Long-Covid, but I have retreated. Without giving away too much I’ll just say, it’s time to try again, be brave, and be myself, and take some steps forward. For this, I need some scaffolding around me and some people on my side.

I don’t know if it’s a sense of pride and a feeling that I should have this life thing sorted by now, or, the difficult and counterproductive experiences I have had with Mental Health Services in the past when I was far more vulnerable, but somehow I’d lost the ability to reach out for help without even knowing it. I thought I should be able to do it all myself and I’d lost trust in others.

I’d had therapy, some helpful and some really not so helpful. I should be okay yeah?

What has helped is that at the end of last year, I did speak to a new GP and I asked for help, spurred on by a friend. Different help. This time I was able to express and articulate myself more easily, and I was lucky to speak with people who were insightful and empathic, and what’s important is that I didn’t feel like a ‘service-user, ‘ this time I felt like a human being. It’s provided me with a little bit of comfort and hope that once the cogs of 2022 start turning, I’ll have some people to talk to. I won’t be alone as I try and navigate the challenges ahead.

Okay – about that run! And then maybe Netflix later 🙂

My message is, if there is one, to not give up. And it’s okay to go steady.

Taking a small detour for the moment, I thought I would try and look at bit more closely at corruption. How do you define it? What is it? I believe if you are going to defeat something, you first need to understand what it is. Know thine enemy, as they say.

I began by looking up the word corruption in a dictionary, which defined it thus:

Corruption: ‘dishonest or fraudulent conduct by those in power, typically involving bribery.’

However, that is not really what I think of, when I think of corruption. An occasional trip to the theatre, or nice meal in a restaurant from time to time. Whilst imperfect, actions like this are not enough to constitute a major problem.

Corruption, to me, is when the entire system is taken over. Where almost everyone either takes part, or instead chooses to remain silent. At which point no actions can be trusted.

This is the situation that developed within FIFA (Fédération internationale de football association meaning International Association Football Federation) under Sepp Blatter’s leadership. Where hosting the football World Cup became an exercise in bribery from which no-one, and nothing, was immune.

Any man, or woman, who refused to take a bribe from FIFA was the exception, not the rule. Envelopes stuffed with cash were handed out in hotel rooms. At which point we had a completely corrupt organisation. Which is bad enough, on a relatively small scale, in an organisation that deals only with football.

On a larger scale, what happens when corruption affects everything? According to a global corruption index, the worst five countries in the world for corruption are:

Syria

North Korea

Congo, Dem. Rep

Yemen

South Sudan

The lowest five ‘risk’ countries for corruption are – starting with the best:

Norway

Finland

Sweden

Denmark

Estonia

It is no coincidence that the quality of life, and the wealth and happiness of people in these countries, indeed every country in the world, is closely tied to how corrupt those countries are. Indeed, the association between corruption, and quality of life, moves virtually in lock-stop.

Which means that corruption represents one of the gravest problems humanity faces. The worse it becomes, the more everything else falls apart. Given time, it eventually eats out the very structures that allowed it to exist in the first place. See under “The Roman Empire”.

Moving onto the bribery part of corruption. I also believe that bribery is about far more than just money. Whilst money represents the most obvious way to ‘bribe’ people. there is also power.

I quote you, Frank Underwood, the main fictional character in House of Cards.

‘Such a waste of talent. He chose money over power. Money is the Mc-mansion in Sarasota that starts falling apart after 10 years. Power is the old stone building that stands for centuries. I cannot respect someone who doesn’t see the difference.’

Then there is status. To stand tallest amongst your peers.

‘A good reputation is more valuable than money.’ Publilius Syros.

Nelson Mandela was uninterested in money, but at one time he was probably the most influential and highest status man in the world. Not, I hasten to add, that I think Nelson Mandela was in any way corrupt. But had he chosen to be …

Whilst it is difficult to define corruption perfectly, I would try to define it as … people doing things that are ‘paid’ for by others. Those who are paid gain what they greatly desire. Status, reputation, authority, power – all the same sort of thing, but not quite. And, of course, money. Those paying also gain what they want – usually more money.

For a system to be considered ‘corrupt’ a large number of those within it must take part. Those not actively taking bribes are also complicit, in that they have chosen to do nothing about it. They put up and/or they shut up. Worst of all, I think, is when they try to excuse it.

Money

Sticking to money for the moment and directing the discussion more specifically to the medical world. There was a time when the pharmaceutical industry was happy to pay doctors, and researchers, directly. Straight into the old bank account. No questions asked. Kerrching!

We would like you to give a lecture. Ten grand…kerrching! We want you to chair a think tank on the use of drugs in rheumatoid arthritis. Twenty grand … kerrching! We would like you to act as a consultant over the next two years in order to assist in our drug development programme. Fifty grand a year … kerrching! Run a clinical trial (put your name up as one of the main authors anyway). Don’t worry, you won’t actually have to write anything – or probably even read it. Two hundred grand … kerrching!

Or, taking a real-world example, let us have a look at Oxford Professor Sir Richard Doll. This is the man who, along with Bradford Hill, proved that smoking causes lung cancer. He is a hero to many within the medical profession.

As it turns out he was also paid $1,500 a day, for twenty years, by Monsanto. Which is a total of eleven million dollars. Kerrching!

At one point the Chemical Manufacturers Association, along with Dow Chemicals and ICI, dropped £15K into his bank account. This was for a review which cleared vinyl chloride of causing cancer – of any kind. This review was then used to defend the use of this chemical – now well recognised to be a cancer-causing agent – for over a decade.1

In addition:

‘While he was being paid by Monsanto, Sir Richard wrote to a royal Australian commission investigating the potential cancer-causing properties of Agent Orange, made by Monsanto and used by the US in the Vietnam war. Sir Richard said there was no evidence that the chemical caused cancer.’

How does that make you feel? I have to say I was disappointed, to say the least. Up until this revelation I thought he was one of the good guys. A benevolent, Nelson Mandela-like figure:

However, following these revelations, he was not criticised. Instead, he was robustly defended – which I take as a key signal that corruption has taken over the system:

‘Professor John Toy, medical director of Cancer Research UK, which funded much of Sir Richard’s work, said times had changed and the accusations must be put into context. “Richard Doll’s lifelong service to public health has saved millions of lives. His pioneering work demonstrated the link between smoking and lung cancer and paved the way towards current efforts to reduce tobacco’s death toll,” he said. “In the days he was publishing it was not automatic for potential conflicts of interest to be declared in scientific papers.’

It might not have been automatic to declare conflicts of interest Professor Toy. But that does not make it right. If you are paid tens of millions by the industry, you are no longer a disinterested scientist, and you cannot pretend otherwise. It was wrong at the time, just as it is now, as it always will be. [Nowadays conflicts of interest are far more carefully hidden away].

There were other defenders, from Oxford University.

‘Yesterday, Sir Richard Peto, the Oxford-based epidemiologist who worked closely with him, said the allegations came from those who wanted to damage Sir Richard’s reputation for their own reasons. Sir Richard had always been open about his links with industry and gave all his fees to Green College, Oxford, the postgraduate institution he founded, he said.’

This statement was from the same article which began with these words

‘A world-famous British scientist failed to disclose that he held a paid consultancy with a chemical company for more than 20 years while investigating cancer risks in the industry.’

So it seems, Sir Richard Peto, that Sir Richard Doll was not open about his links with industry. Not in the slightest. No-one in the wider world had the faintest idea. Did those in Oxford University really know? If so, did they actually condone his work on Vinyl Chloride and Agent Orange? They certainly did not breathe a word of criticism.

Instead, we get … ‘the allegations came from those who wanted to damage Sir Richard’s eruption for their own reasons.’ In short, it is those making the allegations who are the bad guys. See under … children accusing priests of sexual abuse in the early days. ‘How dare evil children accuse these noble men of such things?’ Such things that they actually did, you mean.

And what reason could anyone have for damaging the reputation of man who was already dead, with these terrible ‘allegations?’ None was given, because there are no such reasons. Also, these were not ‘allegations’, they were facts. What should they have done, kept their mouths shut?

No, here is what those who worked with Sir Richard Doll should have said, or something very like it.

‘Sir Richard Doll did highly important work in proving that cigarettes cause lung cancer. Work that has benefitted hundreds of millions. However, he took large sums of money from commercial companies and then wrote papers in support of those companies, which resulted in a great deal of harm. We cannot condone these actions. This has seriously damaged his reputation, as it should. We will work to ensure that this type of situation never happens again.’

However, it seems that if you are seen as a ‘great’ person, who has done great work, you cannot possibly be accused of corruption. Even if the evidence is laid out before us all, in black and white.

Perhaps you think I am being rather harsh here. Focussing my attack on one ‘great’ man, now dead. In truth, I picked on this case for a couple of reasons. First, I want to make it clear that corruption is not a new thing in medical research – although it has greatly worsened – and gone undercover. Second, I hope to make it clear that those with a reputation for doing ‘great work’ are just as likely to be corrupt as anyone else.

In truth, they are the most likely to be corrupt. How so? Because they have achieved such high status that they have risen beyond suspicion. In addition, the ‘great ones’ have made themselves immensely valuable. Which means that they are actively sought out. They have both status, and influence.

Authority = power = influence

Influence ↔ money.

Influence is the currency here. And currency is very easily converted into money, and back again. If you can find the most influential ‘great person’ or ‘great institution’ or great ‘great medical journal.’ You pay them the money, and you get the influence you desire.

‘Sir Richard Doll himself says that vinyl chloride is perfectly safe, and how dare you argue with him – you pathetic nobody.’

Or, to quote the industry view on such matters:

‘Key Opinion Leader is regarded as the mastermind in the pharma industry. They’ve put in the time and research to be recognized by their peers as experts in their field. As a result, they have gained a reputation as a thought leader within their specific niche. Their expert opinions and actions can significantly affect the adoption of a new product/brand or the ability to influence consumer purchasing decisions.

Key Opinion Leaders are sort of like the avengers of the clinical research world. They can fill many different roles, and their skill sets are highly sought after by those in the know. A key opinion leader can be critically important in helping to educate physicians about a new drug. They can provide information about the working of drugs, which patient demographics can benefit the most, and what treatment regimens are most effective. KOLs can also offer their unique insights as early adopters of new therapies, which can help to identify and create brand acceptance in healthcare.’2

Nowadays there are entire companies dedicated to nurturing and developing Key Opinion Leaders and helping them work with pharmaceutical industry. Or vice-versa. Here, from the horse’s mouth. An article entitled: ‘KOL management in Pharma and Life Sciences.’

‘As pharmaceutical and life-sciences companies search for the most effective, efficient ways to manage collaboration with the physicians who conduct research, write articles, or speak on their behalf, relationship management of the interaction with these elite physicians, or key opinion leaders (KOLs), has ultimately emerged as an individual business discipline. Similar to CRM, KOL management is an essential component for marketers and medical staff throughout the life-cycle process of a specific drug or product.

By sustaining a business process that creates and maintains meaningful and collaborative relationships between KOLs and business functions from marketing to medical affairs, pharmaceutical and life-sciences companies can experience increased share of voice and accelerated adoptions at the global, national, and regional levels. A CEO of a major pharmaceuticals company recently told a group of analysts that effectively managing KOL relationships was essential to companies’ future products and market expansion.’ 3

Today, almost all of the great people (Key Opinion Leaders), institutions, medical societies and medical journals have been captured by the industry – to a greater or lesser extent. As far back as 2009, the long-time editor of the New England Journal of Medicine wrote these words. Words that I have quoted several times before, but they need almost endless repetition.

‘It is simply no longer possible to believe much of the clinical research that is published, or to rely on the judgment of trusted physicians or authoritative medical guidelines. I take no pleasure in this conclusion, which I reached slowly and reluctantly over my two decades as an editor of The New England Journal of Medicine.’

What happened following this scathing attack? Nothing. Yet these words come from the editor of the most influential (highest impact factor) journal in the World. Someone who spent her entire working life reviewing the quality of medical research, assessing how robust medical guidelines are, and how trustworthy our ‘trusted’ physicians might be.

The answers to those questions being ‘rubbish’, ‘biased’ and ‘corrupt’ in that order.

I have occasionally asked myself: “What would be the worst effect of corruption of medical research”? Well, there are the obvious things. First that we cannot believe a damned thing that is published. With certain provisos – there are honest researchers out there.

Equally bad, or perhaps worse, doctors end up prescribing medicines that do no good, and possibly do harm. Based on biased physicians running biased trials, followed up by biased guidelines, to be published in biased journals.

These are, of course, in themselves terrible things.

But there is something else, which may actually be worse in the long run. If research is directed almost entirely towards ideas that support commercial goals, then this will end up crushing work that dares look in different directions. Try publishing a paper suggesting that cholesterol lowering is a waste of time, when the market for cholesterol lowering drugs is worth hundreds of billions.

Yes, you may be lucky enough to get something into a lower impact journal, but the bigger journals will block you completely. Come up with a different hypothesis as to what actually causes cardiovascular disease, and the big journals will not touch it with a bargepole.

Science only lives, and progresses, when the status quo is regularly attacked, and disrupted. But within a corrupt system, where the majority of funding comes from commercial sources, innovation grinds to a halt. Primarily because new ideas threaten profit. Try stating that Type II diabetes can be reversed with exercise and a low carbohydrate diet, and you are threatening a $200Bn market for diabetes medications. So, good luck with that.

Which leads me to perhaps the most soul-destroying article I have read recently. It was a review of disruptive science. By which the authors meant, the degree to which a scientific paper shakes up the field.

‘The authors reasoned that if a study was highly disruptive, subsequent research would be less likely to cite the study’s references, and instead cite the study itself. Using the citation data from 45 million manuscripts and 3.9 million patents, the researchers calculated a measure of disruptiveness, called the ‘CD index’, in which values ranged from –1 for the least disruptive work to 1 for the most disruptive.

The average CD index declined by more than 90% between 1945 and 2010 for research manuscripts (see ‘Disruptive science dwindles’), and by more than 78% from 1980 to 2010 for patents. Disruptiveness declined in all of the analysed research fields and patent types, even when factoring in potential differences in factors such as citation practices.’

Just have a look at the graph 4:

It is hard to think of a more depressing graph. Looking specifically at life sciences and biomedicine – otherwise known as medical research. It would seem that since the mid-1990s there has been virtually no disruptive science published – at all, anywhere.

The article itself states that ‘disruptive science has declined – and no-one knows why?’

Well, to my mind, there are two possibilities for this decline. The first is that we now know virtually everything across all scientific fields. Therefore, disruptive science has inevitably declined, because there is nothing new to be discovered. We simply know it all.

Of course, this echoes a famous comment by Lord Kelvin at the end of the nineteenth century. ‘There is nothing new to be discovered in physics now. All that remains is more and more precise measurement.’ Ahem, have you come across this chap Einstein by any chance?

The second possibility is that some factor, we shall call it factor K (for corruption) has virtually taken over science, particularly medical science. This factor when combined with money, factor M, has the effect of destroying innovation (I). Thus, squashing disruptive research (DR) flat.

The equation is simple. I ÷ (K x M) = DR

Innovation, divided by (corruption multiplied by money) = Disruption Index.

As the flow of industry money into research has multiplied, innovation and new ideas have shrivelled and died. This, anyway, is my working hypothesis. You may feel there are other reasons. In which case, I would be interested to hear them.

So, yes, I think that corruption is incredibly important. Particularly within the world of science, where mavericks and innovators are absolutely essential. Graphene, for example, an actual major scientific breakthrough. This was discovered by two scientists, Andrei Geim and Kostya Novoselov playing about with pencils and sticky tape in a laboratory in Manchester University.

Playing about in a lab! Research nowadays is driven by funding. Funding is driven by commercial applications. The ‘best’ researchers today know how to bring in money for their labs, and for their universities. Today, researchers need to be productive and drive the income stream. To quote Peter Higgs: ‘I wouldn’t be productive enough for today’s academic system.’

‘Peter Higgs, the British physicist who gave his name to the Higgs boson, believes no university would employ him in today’s academic system because he would not be considered “productive” enough.

The emeritus professor at Edinburgh University, who says he has never sent an email, browsed the internet or even made a mobile phone call, published fewer than 10 papers after his ground-breaking work, which identified the mechanism by which subatomic material acquires mass, was published in 1964.

He doubts a similar breakthrough could be achieved in today’s academic culture, because of the expectations on academics to collaborate and keep churning out papers. He said: “It’s difficult to imagine how I would ever have enough peace and quiet in the present sort of climate to do what I did in 1964.’ 5

‘Collaborate and keep churning out papers.’ This is the Henry T Ford school of research. We need more research! Quantity is what matters. Churning out papers requires money. To get money we have to sell … ourselves.

But innovative research, disruptive research, is not about quantity. It is about quality. One paper on subatomic materials acquiring mass. This is worth an infinite number of papers on how wonderful statins are. But an infinite number of papers on statins is what we now get.

Today, universities sell themselves on their collaboration with industry. Opinion leaders are hugely valuable to the industry, and therefore to their universities. They cannot afford to consider doing research which threatens the flow of money. So, they don’t.

This has become the medical research world that we live in today. It is no longer innovative, disruptive, or challenging. It is almost entirely bought and paid for. It has become Zombie Science. To quote Bruce Charlton, once again, from his paper. ‘Zombie science: a sinister consequence of evaluating scientific theories purely on the basis of enlightened self-interest.’

In the real world it looks more like most scientists are quite willing to pursue wrong ideas for so long as they are rewarded with a better chance of achieving more grants, publications and status. The classic account has it that bogus theories should readily be demolished by sceptical (or jealous) competitor scientists. However, in practice even the most conclusive ‘hatchet jobs’ may fail to kill, or even weaken, phoney hypotheses when they are backed-up with sufficient economic muscle in the form of lavish and sustained funding. And when a branch of science based on phoney theories serves a useful but non-scientific purpose, it may be kept-going indefinitely by continuous transfusions of cash from those whose interests it serves.’ 6

When the journal Nature notes that disruptive science has declined, and no-one knows why … I think this is utter balls. There are plenty of people who know why. The journal Nature also probably knows why. However, if they were to say why, it would open the door to something so big and ugly that no-one wants to even look at it, let alone deal with it.

Better to keep that door firmly shut. That door to the Zombie room. The place where undead science roams. Where innovation, disruption and science itself … died. In the end corruption consumes the host.

A new UK alternative proteins strategy should be developed by the Government within the next 12 months, the think-tank report said.
This report argues that government should adopt a policy position that expands consumer choice and the market for alternative proteins.","proteins, alternative, plantbased, food, falling, meat, inertia, report, uk, eu, smf, means, british, china, risks, transition","The Social Market Foundation said that alternative proteins – including plant-based, fermented and cultivated meat – can help address climate change, improve animal welfare and increase consumer choice.

Its report – called Putting British success on the menu: Time for a UK alternative proteins strategy​ – said supporting the creation and sale of alternative proteins could also create jobs and open up new export opportunities for the UK.

Retail sales in western Europe rose 19% to a record €2.4 billion in 2021, according the Good Food Institute, an NGO. Vegetable and plant-based alternatives were equivalent to 4% of total meat sales in 2021, worth around £1.5bn.

Last year British alternative protein businesses attracted over £150 million of capital investment.

But the SMF found that Government departments lack a coherent approach to policies on alternative protein, meaning British productive capacity is likely to lag against other advanced economies. China recently adopted a five-year plan to support cultivated meat, while Denmark and the Netherlands are spending hundreds of millions of euros on research and development.

In the Netherlands, for example, an initial €60 million government investment has been made to support the development of a cellular agriculture ecosystem. Denmark has earmarked $168 million for plant-based R&D, including the $100 million Plant Fund announced in April 2022, as part of a new climate deal approved by all major political parties.

In contrast, the SMF said UK alternative protein policy was underdeveloped and underfunded, with responsibility scattered between government departments.

The SMF report drew on a discussion of senior policymakers and officials and was sponsored by Impossible Foods. The SMF said it retained editorial independence.

Experts at the SMF roundtable reported that a lack of overall policy ownership and Whitehall inaction are preventing the UK from developing and implementing a clear strategy on alternative proteins.

Ministers have failed to grip the issue despite identifying alternative proteins as a post-Brexit “opportunity”, ​the SMF said.

“A failure to act soon risks the UK falling behind international competitors, foregoing opportunities for British businesses, and hindering the transition to greener diets. Government must do more to catalyse a consumer-led transition in dietary behaviours​,” the SMF report said.

The SMF emphasised that alternative proteins are an opportunity to boost consumer choice and warned against measures like meat taxes that restrict what people can buy and eat.

Instead, the report calls on policymakers to help British businesses in the global race for affordable, healthy and tasty alternatives to animal-based meat, dairy and seafood.

A new UK alternative proteins strategy should be developed by the Government within the next 12 months, the think-tank report said.

“The strategy should adopt a long-term perspective and consider the wide-ranging possibilities and challenges arising from the protein transition,”​ the SMF said.

Linus Pardoe, SMF research associate, said: “Sustainable proteins will be a big part of British diets over the coming decade and this is a real opportunity for Britain’s leading food industry, entrepreneurs and scientists to come together to make alternatives affordable, tasty, and healthy. At the moment, the Government isn’t doing enough to light the fires of innovation and drive a consumer-led transition to greener diets.”​

“The Government has pointed to alternative proteins as an archetypal Brexit opportunity. But current inertia in Whitehall risks squandering opportunities for British businesses, offshoring the benefits of sustainable proteins to countries like China, Denmark, and the Netherlands.”​

Pat Brown, Impossible Foods Founder and Chief Visionary Officer, said: “The rapid development and adoption of plant-based proteins is an extraordinary opportunity for positive, consumer-driven change, and it has the potential to be a powerful part of the UK’s ambitious goal of reaching Net Zero by 2050. UK policymakers should not overlook the power of the food system as both a major economic growth driver and a solution to the world's climate issues.”​

Other recommendations from the report: • The Government should commission an innovation needs assessment for alternative proteins to better understand the scale of R&D required and where money could be spent most effectively. • Supermarkets should publicly disclose what proportion of protein sales come from plant-based products, striving to reach 30% by 2030. • Reforms to Government Buying Standards for food should leverage the power of the public sector to aid the transition to meat, dairy and seafood alternatives. • Improve public data on animal-based protein consumption.

Greenwashing and ‘culture war’ concerns​

But is it counterproductive to focus on the environmental credentials of alt proteins?

For example, Tesco’s ‘Plant Chef’ vegan burger adverts have been banned by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) after being accused of making “misleading” claims.

Tesco had implied that buying Plant Chef burgers would “positively affect the environment”​ as it suggested that customers could “do their bit”​ for the environment by swapping to plant-based burgers.

But the ASA concluded that the “claims regarding their positive benefits to the planet had not been substantiated and were likely to mislead”.​

Concerning this ruling, campaigning organisation the Countryside Alliance said: “The judgment should not be ‘meat bad, plant-based good’, but ‘locally sourced and sustainably produced good, food miles and heavily processed bad’.​

""Red meat produced in Britain is among the most sustainable in the world. Despite the endless propaganda, cattle and sheep account for just 3.7 per cent of UK carbon emissions if you include the carbon stored in grassland and, unlike some plant-based products, very little meat consumed in the UK comes from systems that deplete rainforests and generate large amounts of emissions. ​

“Knowing where your food comes from and how it is produced is far more important than whether it is animal or vegetable. Challenging assumptions about the benefits of some plant-based products and the casual denigration of livestock farming matters because, if they are allowed to go unchallenged they threaten the sustainability of both the planet and the countryside.”​

Could this polarised atmosphere dissuade some consumers from buying plant-based/(future) cultivated products, as well as increase the instances of corporate greenwashing?

The SMF told FoodNavigator it recognises concerns about a culture war over meat consumption and makes the case that this should be fundamentally a question of consumer choice. Its report states: ""The Government’s Net Zero strategy pledges to work “with the grain of consumer choice” as the UK decarbonises. This report argues that government should adopt a policy position that expands consumer choice and the market for alternative proteins. A failure to act soon risks the UK falling behind international competitors, foregoing opportunities for British businesses, and hindering the transition to greener diets.""​

That said, “it is hard to overstate the evidence that alternative proteins have considerable environmental advantages when compared with meat, dairy and seafood products on the market,” ​said the SMF’s Pardoe. “This evidence is increasingly robust, and we reference several studies in the report. ​

“Nonetheless, our report does point to evidence that the socio-economic impact of alternative proteins has been under addressed, perhaps because of an over-focus on AP's environmental credentials. Hence, we point to potential economic gains, improvements in animal welfare, and opportunities for arable farmers.”​

Pardoe disputed some of the claims made by the Countryside Alliance, particularly with regards to meat consumed in the UK being disconnected from deforestation. But he stressed: “We are not advocating for a zero-sum game. In the report we state there is an opportunity for alternative proteins, alongside ‘traditional’ plant-based proteins, to play an important role in our food system harmoniously with more extensive agricultural practices.""​"

Liam Flannigan, Eugenia Cronin, Liam Crosby & Ellie Houlston, Members of the Public Health & Adult Social Care SIG","public, better, adult, working, care, health, support, social, teams, population, need","The new duty on the Care Quality Commission (CQC) to assess local authorities’ delivery of their adult social care (ASC) duties under the Care Act 2014 came into effect on 1 April 2023. Since then, local authorities (LAs) in England have been preparing for CQC assessments of their adult social care services.

The CQC assessment process may have the effect of boosting interest in joint working between ASC and public health teams. Directors of Public Health and their teams are expected to actively participate in the assessment, through contributing to the self-assessment and information returns and being interviewed as part of the process.

Through this closer working for CQC preparation, new opportunities for collaboration between public health and adult social care could emerge that build on areas of shared interest. Most notably, the emphasis on prevention within adult social care means there are opportunities for developing shared approaches to intervening upstream, with roles for public health, social care and wider partners across the health and care system.

“It is critical to the vision in the Care Act that the care and support system works to actively promote wellbeing and independence, and does not just wait to respond when people reach a crisis point” Care and Support Statutory Guidance

Does this new requirement open the door to other opportunities?

Public Health teams in English LAs are often located within the same directorates as Adults Social Care, but the degree to which there is close working is likely to vary.

Our SIG has been working on this area for a few years, having started by exploring primary prevention in the context of adult social care in 2022. We think there are opportunities for improving health and wellbeing at a population level that could be realised through closer working between the two disciplines. Here are some of those:

The population of residents who are assessed for and those who become clients of adult social care will tend to be one of significant need, unmet need and inequality, in which there may be potential to support health improvement..

Through working with adult social care, public health teams can provide data and insights that contextualise trends in social care service provision within broader patterns in population health and wellbeing. This framing of social care need as a whole-population question, rather than limited to those receiving support, can widen the scope for prevention-focused work and can support social care commissioners to implement interventions that address the drivers of social care need locally. Use of population health data can also help in identifying groups who may experience inequalities in social care outcomes, and population groups who may have unmet need, based on what is known about their health and wellbeing.

In addition, linked health and social care data can provide insights into the health needs of people receiving social care support, which in turn enables effective targeting of interventions to address the health needs of a group that often experience adverse health outcomes.

The common interest in prevention and in improving wellbeing at a population level lends itself to developing shared approaches to prevention, even if adult social care has traditionally had a stronger focus on those actively receiving support. This recognises both the role adult social care plays in meeting the support needs of a population group with significant health and social care need, and the wider benefits of preventing ill-health, in mitigating future demand for social care services.

Public health teams can greatly benefit from greater engagement with ASC. Insights from social care practitioners can be valuable in understanding the health needs of people in receipt of social care support, and through effective integrated working social care teams can support service users to access preventive healthcare services that can improve health and care outcomes. Social care can also play a positive role in addressing growing public health challenges such as multimorbidity and the disproportionate effects on people living in areas of higher deprivation, by providing a more holistic understanding of “need” for support that considers not just what medical treatment looks like for two or more conditions, but how people’s lives can be improved through support from across a whole system that includes social care.

There may be other opportunities for mutual learning: the strengths-based ethos of adult social care has much to offer, and there is value in public health teams learning more about working directly with service users to deliver effective services.

There are challenges as well. The public health profession and the adult social care profession have different starting points in terms of core concepts and training. The concept of ‘social care need’ has been described as needing a consistent definition, and day to day terms such as ‘prevention’ and ‘needs assessment’ have quite different meanings

We recognise that the starting point for this blog, with its focus on CQC inspections has direct relevance only for England. We are interested in whether there are similar arrangements in the devolved UK nations, so please do get in touch to let us know. And we are always keen to hear from Faculty members who would like to join the SIG!

We are currently working on Top Tips for public health colleagues working with adult social care, which will build on the content here and is likely to address issues such as how to understand what population need for adult social care looks like, areas for mutual learning, and how can we find a shared understanding of prevention.

The pandemic has been extremely hard on many of us. We believe the best way forward for everyone is to get vaccinated and continue to follow CDC guidance on masking. Throughout the pandemic, we have also provided COVID-related resources to support our volunteer moderators, users, and communities, including a dedicated AMA series connecting users with authoritative experts on coronavirus and vaccines, as well as deploying homepage and search page banners directing users to the CDC and r/Coronavirus.

We appreciate that not everyone agrees with the current approach to getting us all through the pandemic, and some are still wary of vaccinations. Dissent is a part of Reddit and the foundation of democracy. Reddit is a place for open and authentic discussion and debate. This includes conversations that question or disagree with popular consensus. This includes conversations that criticize those that disagree with the majority opinion. This includes protests that criticize or object to our decisions on which communities to ban from the platform.

While we appreciate the sentiment of those demanding that we ban more communities that challenge consensus views on the pandemic, we continue to believe in the good of our communities and hope that we collectively approach the challenges of the pandemic with empathy, compassion, and a willingness to understand what others are going through, even when their viewpoint on the pandemic is different from yours.

When it comes to COVID-19 specifically, what we know and what are the current best practices from authoritative sources, like the CDC, evolve continuously with new learnings. Given the rapid state of change, we believe it is best to enable communities to engage in debate and dissent, and for us to link to the CDC wherever appropriate. While we believe the CDC is the best and most up to date source of information regarding COVID-19, disagreeing with them is not against our policies.

However, manipulating or cheating Reddit to amplify any particular viewpoint is against our policies, and we will continue to action communities that do so or that violate any of our other rules, including those dedicated to fraud (e.g. fake vaccine cards) or encouraging harm (e.g. consuming bleach); and we will continue to use our quarantine tool to link to authoritative sources and warn people they may encounter unsound advice. We humbly ask and encourage everyone to report content that may violate our policies.

Vaccine Injunction

We are calling for an injunction to pause to the vaccine rollout to due to multiple questions we have

​

1 - Why are so many people suffering adverse events and death after COVID-19 vaccinations?

​

2 - Why are so many of our fittest sportspeople collapsing and suffering myocarditis, heart attacks and death post-vaccination?

​

3 - Why have the vaccine manufacturers withheld ingredients? Undisclosed ingredients are illegal and involve the deception of the public

​

4 - Why have independent scientific reports of Graphene Oxide and other contaminants not been publically investigated?

​

5 - Why are the batches of the vaccine clearly different? As per VAERS data, 100% of all adverse reactions can be attributed to 5% of the batches. This clearly indicates suspect manufacturing"

I know lots of people are scared of needles etc but it really can be worth getting blood tests - as far as I was aware PCOS can be diagnosed by either scan or blood tests but scans aren't conclusive - I have PCOS but my ovaries are fine (or at least they were when I got scanned). So a blood test would confirm that you have it (rather than just the symptoms which aren't necessarily exclusive to PCOS...)



When I was younger I spent a bit of time on some forums and it was nice to hear how other people managed etc.I think one of them was Verity? But one of them had a section for teens/young people which was nice.



I found my teens very difficult - both before and after diagnosis but since being put on medication to control my symptoms (periods) I feel much better and my life is so much better than it was.

The top 100 tweets on the basis of retweets received are listed in the following Wakelet summary: https://wakelet.com/wake/KBSc6At7WT-FzECPxweKD (100 tweets posted by 60 Twitter accounts including the following languages: English, Spanish, Japanese, Malay, Arabic and Tamil).

Further analysis of these data –– e.g. the breakdown by tweeter, retweeter and mentioned accounts; multivariable analysis using approach from 2018 campaign (peer reviewed paper here) –– would be possible using the data collected, but would take time.

The main lesson for the 2021 campaign is that we need more hashtag discipline for public health campaigns – hashtag drift dilutes messages, and risks missing otherwise high quality content. Use of additional hashtags can help Twitter users identify content of interest within the large number of tweets posted for a campaign, but that requires careful planning and coordination. Monitoring Twitter activity during such campaigns requires vigilance as new hashtags can emerge during the campaign.

A news story on social prescribing boomed out of my radio on Monday morning – another jolly report about how this was the way to manage long-term conditions in the community. NHS England had announced a plan to roll out the scheme across the country by recruiting 1,000 social prescribing “link workers” to support GPs and help people improve their health and well-being. It felt alienating, because of my own personal experience of social prescribing.

On the face of it, social prescribing is a good idea – a supplemental service for people with long-term conditions. People with mild to moderate conditions who live in areas where suitable activities are available but who struggle with online searches and need a bit of guidance and motivation may well benefit. Having someone to signpost them to local activities can help them start to improve their general well-being.

The main beneficiary of social prescribing will be GPs – the NHS England announcement was headed “An army of workers to support family doctors” for good reason. Hard-pressed GPs will be able to refer patients to someone else and free up their consulting room at a time when we face a GP shortage.

However, there are a number of problems with social prescribing, especially as it impacts on people with serious long-term mental ill-health.

I speak from personal experience. I live with serious long-term mental ill-health and am currently poorly. NICE guidelines and local healthcare policy specify that I need and should be provided with ongoing care for my ongoing serious health condition. However, I was recently discharged from the community mental health team altogether, to nothing. People with serious chronic physical health conditions would not be discharged from specialist services in this way.

What helps me to is a combination of specialist services, mainstream resources and things that everyone needs like an income, a roof over your head, friends, a spiritual life and meaningful activity.

I first came across social prescribing in 2015. Access to the specialist day centre for people with severe and enduring mental illness (such as schizophrenia and bipolar) I’d been attending since being sectioned had been withdrawn as a result of council funding cuts.

When I asked my GP what I should do now, she referred me to their social prescriber scheme. It turned out to just be sign-posting by a “well-being coordinator”. They’d simply done an online search of a public database of activities in the local area that were open to the general population.

The activities were the sort of thing you’d find advertised in your local library or coffee shop, like exercise, art and ballroom dancing classes, history groups, chess clubs, yoga and gardening groups, run by local businesses or community groups.

The activities they proposed were completely inaccessible to me as a disabled person. In addition, many of the activities required payment (the specialist centre was free at the point of use). The result was that people like me, who had previously been supported to lead full lives despite our serious long-term mental illness, were left sitting at home, staring at the TV.

Shortly after that, I moved to a new area where there was also a GP social prescribing service. The local area has no activities that people with severe mental illness could be referred to, so all I was offered was a mainstream exercise referral scheme lasting a few weeks. I was not able to take this up because my disability means it is completely inaccessible.

What do I mean by “inaccessible”? It can be hard for people who don’t have lived experience to understand why community activities may be inaccessible for those of us living with serious mental ill-health. It’s not that they are scheduled to take place at inconvenient times or are not on a bus route – living with serious mental illness can be just as debilitating as physical disability. The experience of serious mental ill-health varies hugely, and people have different triggers and barriers. As Mark Brown (@MarkOneinFour, writer in residence at the Centre for Mental Health and mental health writer) says:

“When you experience more severe mental health difficulties, it can be hard to access everyday community activities. Not because of times or locations, but because you know you have different requirements that you’d have to explain and put out in the open to people who still might not understand. You might need extra support, have challenges doing things like speaking out loud or doing things that involve touch. You might need to be able to leave at any time, or have extreme challenges feeling safe or supported. It’s difficult to trust that an open community activity will provide that and that people won’t treat you as a second class citizen.

“Sometimes things people with more severe mental health experiences need go beyond encouragement and being friendly and actually require specialist support and care from people trained to provide that.

“Sometimes opportunities run by people who have also lived with mental health difficulty and distress can be a better option, but many have closed due to lack of funding over the last decade.

“Without a lot of planning, community activities cannot, and should not, be an alternative to professional support. Severe mental illness really is severe.”

Social prescribing exemplifies a wider issue in mental health care: money is being put into services for folks with mild to moderate conditions at the same time as services for serious mental ill-health are slashed. Effectively, money is being transferred from the latter to the former.

One issue is that it overlooks what’s already there, including occupational therapists and social workers. This is the work they are trained to do and have been doing for years, and I don’t think they have even been consulted for their views. Recruiting low-paid link workers to signpost people is not equivalent to their expertise.

The main issue, however, is that social prescribing is being rolled out after a decade of cuts to core community mental health services. People living with long-term serious health problems – whether physical or mental – need long-term care, treatment and support. We are losing our specialist services while what’s on offer via social prescribing is inaccessible. We are being left high and dry.

Cutting care and support to people with the most serious health problems is inherently risky. People with severe mental ill-health already die 15 to 20 years early from preventable physical causes. Despite government announcements of increased funding for some specific services (such as perinatal mental health care), funding for core community mental health services continues to be cut and those services are being hollowed out.

Requiring people with serious health conditions to get sicker before any help is provided, and discharging people while we are still seriously poorly, is hugely detrimental. The result is people are forced to suffer needlessly and may never get back on our feet. How cruel. What a waste.

Nationally, just yesterday Health Services Journal reported that Early Intervention in Psychosis services – these are for seriously unwell people who are having their first experience of psychosis and urgently need help – had begun limiting access by raising referral thresholds, limiting the age range and discharging people earlier. This is a flagship policy in the government’s mental health plans and does not have sufficient funding to realise its targets.

I have experienced good care, and I know what a difference it can make. Before I moved here, I lived in an area where there were (formerly) multiple resources that supported folks who were living with serious chronic health conditions.

At the specialist day centre, as well as a range of fantastic activities, I could mix with people who understood, I didn’t have to try to ‘pass for normal’, could go whether my health was good or bad, and had the opportunity to volunteer. Equally important was support from the community mental health team, offering care coordination, medication, talking therapy, welfare benefits support and social care support; my GP practice; supported cooking classes; specialist mental health support workers; and supported exercise classes. Each of these was vital to enable me to manage my severe mental health problems.

People with mental ill-health require input that crosses services boundaries. The specialist and supported provision I received before had gradually enabled me to engage with a couple of mainstream activities – but it took a long time to build towards that, and there would be backwards steps during periods of ill-health when I would need to start from scratch again.

Being left with nothing but inaccessible mainstream activities aimed at the general public means that these days I have barely any interaction with the community. I am at home almost all the time. The only people I see are my support workers. I am further from health and the workplace than ever.

Social prescribing will not help me with that.

Clinicians anonymously feeding back that they are intending to change their clinical practice because of the experiences and thoughts they have heard from people living with diabetes.","conference, events, downs, ups, regulations, way, speak, think, pwd, blog, research, day, clinicians, diabetes","Some musings on the joys, oddities, encouragement and occasional knock-backs of invites to diabetes events...Apologies for the radio silence of late. I meant to write this post months ago, but somehow never quite managed to grab the time for it. Initially I had planned several posts each detailing different events and experiences, all fascinating and full of wit and laugh out loud anecdote, but eventually they all began to coalesce around a single theme of confused grumpiness, so that’s what you are getting instead.I was lucky enough to be invited to a number of diabetes events in 2019. It’s always an honour and a privilege to receive an invitation, and in no way do I want this post to read as my being in any way ungrateful, or my taking those invites for granted. Because I absolutely do not. I am fully aware of my rare position of being offered an invite - a seat at the table - and it is not something I take lightly. At all.Sometimes I was invited by device manufacturers, other times by pharmaceutical companies, or diabetes charities, or healthcare professionals and researchers. Sometimes I was invited to speak, other times I was invited to listen, or perhaps to participate in discussion and conversation on some diabetes-related topic or other. My travel (and accommodation if needed) was paid for by the inviting organisation, and the events are always fascinating with much for me to learn and take away. Sometimes they were in the UK, but my travel and attendance at EASD in Barcelona formed part of my year - a first for me, and every bit as enormous, interesting and ever-so-slightly overwhelming as I had imagined it might be. Except perhaps more so. (EASD is the European mega-conference for those working in the field of diabetes, it is mindbogglingly big).Almost without exception my attendance at events is surrounded by enthusiastic comments about the importance of hearing the ‘authentic voice’, the lived experience; the punter’s-eye viewpoint. Having people with diabetes at these events seems broadly welcomed and encouraged by most healthcare professionals. Many say how important it is. How vital to hear from and connect to people who live with Diabetes day to day, to hear their experiences, and to listen to their stories. When I’ve been asked to speak, the feedback forms have been overwhelmingly positive, almost to the point of embarrassment. Clinicians anonymously feeding back that they are intending to change their clinical practice because of the experiences and thoughts they have heard from people living with diabetes. “Best talk of the day”, “So important”, “Much to take away from this”... the welcome could not be warmer.When I was appointed to be one of the ‘lay’ members of the NICE Guideline Development Group for T1 in Adults, we had training and support to help us unpick the clinical data that we would be asked to review. It was made very clear from the outset that our voices and contributions, though entirely without medical qualification, were felt to be just as important as anyone else’s on the panel. We were actively encouraged to speak up, and to ask questions - even if we suspected everyone else probably knew the answer... partly because sometimes they didn’t, and would be very glad we had asked for an acronym to be spelled out or some terminology or other explained. We were told how important our participation was felt to be. And to their huge credit, the clinicians and researchers around the table never once gave me the impression that they wished I would shut up, no matter how much they may have been thinking it privately.Increasingly it seems research projects and clinical trials are being put together with PPI inbuilt from the ground up . (PPI being ‘patient and public involvement’ - are we allowed to say ‘’ this week?). It appears that in some cases, perhaps even many or most cases, funding for research and interventions depends upon clinicians and researchers ensuring that the ‘patient and public’ voice is represented, and that there are non-medical people involved in the review, and design of studies and materials.And I think all of this is a good thing. Nothing about us without us.But...From the very first ‘big thing’ I went to (Diabetes UK Professional Conference if I remember rightly), it was clear from the outset that we PWD didn’t belong.“It’s the regulations I’m afraid...” “Nothing we can do...”My first visit to the annual DUK professional conference involved me being ‘co-opted’ as a blogger onto the Press Team. As a person with diabetes I was not allowed to be there. I was not welcome.Mostly this is because of fearsome pharma regulations, which forbid the advertising of almost all pharmaceuticals directly to the general public (hay fever and headache tablets etc aside). Significant fines and penalties hang like a Sword of Damocles above the quivering pharma multinationals who cower beneath it. If you happen to live with T1 diabetes and also be a journalist... or work for a pharmaceutical company... or a diabetes charity... or a device manufacturer... you appear to be immune to the devastating potential impact of walking past a poster for a new T2 medication. But as a mere PWD mortal? Perish the thought.And this strikes me as a little odd. Because. The internet.In a world in which I can look up published research papers on Pubmed, or any number of research outlets, I wonder how damaging it really is for me to see those research results presented and explained, along with lots of context and clarification at a conference. I wonder how much difference there is between reading a article by a journalist about a new medication, thinking it sounds promising, and then asking your clinic about it, versus seeing a poster in an exhibition hall as you walk through to get a coffee. At EASD, while I could attend sessions, there were large ‘no entry’ posters at the entrance to the exhibition hall forbidding my entry.And these regulations are clearly terrifying. At one event I attended last year as a guest speaker, to give my experience and thoughts on diabetes appointments (a blog I really must get around to writing) I was not even allowed to go and choose my own lunch. Some exhibitors, getting wind of my attendance had made the organisers agree *in writing* that I would be chaperoned from the moment I arrived in my car. I had to wait in the reception area, and be taken to a special side room, accompanied at all times. Then someone went to choose a few things for my lunch (because the exhibitors were in the same space as the food). And when I had finished my talk, I was accompanied straight back to my car and I drove away. No time to chat to clinicians. No way to hear anything else. This sounds comedically extreme (and in fact it was) but I’ve heard from others who have been asked to speak and who have been similarly chaperoned, lest their eyes should wander or they stumble upon a discarded leaflet for PintoDactoTrophomax10 and expire from the shock.I am sure the regulations were put in place for very good reasons (witness the bother we are currently in, with antibiotics after overuse driven in part by people going to their GP and demanding them for a viral infection). But really? I genuinely don’t believe they are fit for purpose any more.How often do we see a news story about some new drug or therapy that has been deemed insufficiently effective for widespread use (or too expensive... or both). And parents and supporters are campaigning for access for little Johnny, or attempting to fly overseas to acquire the treatment there.The law is an ass, so they say. And this pharma law seems doubly so. It is a hindrance. And it’s not doing the job it is meant to do.But the thing that I find most troubling about this particular regulation in terms of diabetes, and my own experience of self management is the subtext of it.Essentially, in a sense youread it as saying, “You are unqualified. You are not trusted. You cannot make this decision. You are incapable of understanding the complexities of the issues involved. Keep quiet and do as you are told.” I know it isn’t actually saying that. But I think also... in some ways, it is.To their credit, Diabetes UK have tried to improve access for PWD to new research and created the ‘Insider Day’ - a one-day version of their Professional Conference specifically aimed at people with diabetes, where some of the content from the main conference can be shared in a way that satisfies the rules. But does this (as great as it is) create a two tier ‘dumbing down’ structure? A watering down to make things more palatable and easier to digest? Conference Lite.The other slightly odd thing about getting some of these invites, particularly to the larger events, and where I have been asked to speak, is that some HCPs really wish we PWD weren’t there and would go away and leave them alone. Anonymous feedback forms (you do realise we get those to read afterwards, right?) which are completed with the apparent intention of reflecting this opinion back to organising committees... are also read by the people that give the talks. Some HCPs have suggested in the clearest possible terms that they thought my contribution added absolutely no value at all to the event, and they would much prefer it if I had not been invited to witter on inanely at them. I am not quoting, you understand... but the sentiment was pretty much there.I completely understand the opinion of some HCPs that they would prefer their ‘own space’, and sometimes I see exactly the same wish expressed by people with diabetes about meetings or online spaces. Some people’s preference is to have a place where they can be, and share, and exchange thoughts with just their peers present. With no need to accommodate the sensibilities of others. I can see that sometimes you just want to have natural (unguarded?) interactions with your own. To kick back and not have to worry about minding your Ps and Qs lest someone gets the hump. Even the most supportive and passionate advocates of PWD involvement have been known to express this desire.So I do understand it. But also I genuinely value an open interchange between n=1 lived experience and profound clinical and specialist expertise. I think that while there is a desire for PWD involvement in the conversation, being chaperoned, excluded, not trusted, and made to feel uncomfortable isn’t very helpful for anyone. I think we have much to learn from each other. I’ve seen some conference presentations that have made my head spin with the complexity of it. I’ve not understood all of it by any means, but when something is well presented, even if way above my understanding, I absorb the main thrust of the content, and find I remember it and can apply some of the complex physiology (or whatever) to my lived experience.I also think being in a mixed environment helps to create and maintain respect (though sometimes this seems spectacularly absent in online spaces). I think sharing spaces can create empathy and understanding. It’s not like we are on ‘different sides’ right? Clinicians, researchers and industry want us to have better outcomes, and that’s exactly what we want too.I do believe it is possible for both clinicians and PWD to express their authentic, honest experiences, and also maintain respect, and behave with kindness and courtesy.I look forward to a time when the regulations change, and involvement (or exclusion) is done more openly and intentionally, not under the veil of what seems to me to be a rather outdated rule book.I’d love to hear your thoughts."

Why would a specialist in HIV prefer to have the HIV illness over ME?","instagram, illnesses, welcome, importantly, related, hiv, share, fragmentedme, illness, page, write, read","Welcome to my fragmented.ME blog and advocacy site, started in 2019.

I will begin with a little introductory bit about me. First, and probably most importantly, I have ME, fibromyalgia, chronic migraine, TMJ, MCS, and lots of other ME related illnesses. I have been ill since 1984. At first I was mild, then moderate, and now moderately severe and sadly moving ever closer to very severe. So when I talk and write about these conditions and related ideas, I am coming from the perspective of the ‘patient’ who experiences the illness.

Designing websites and content is not something new for me, but this is a complete new idea (2019). The site will be an extension of my ever growing Instagram Page and will expand on topics I cover there. Yet now (2022), I am happy to say, fragmented.ME has taken on a life of its own.

In light of my advocacy success on Instagram, the things that I will write about here, in much more detail than is possible on Instagram, will include, but are not limited to, some of the ideas that I also share on that platform. Furthermore, I am also happy to accept your suggestions on things you would like me to write about, just contact me.

I must point out that fragmented.ME is not a charity and I will not be asking you to put your hands in your pockets, unless you want to show appreciation for what I write and to buy ME a latte … 😉 …

Or, more importantly, you maybe want to help, fund my ME treatment, presently (2019) being privately funded and provided by the Yorkshire Fatigue Clinic. This funding was originally refused by my local commissioning group because they felt it could be provided in house at my local surgery, but it really hasn’t been and the care / support I received was lacking and below par. So, I am now (2019) paying for it myself or more correctly my husband is paying for it as I am too sick to earn an income.

You can read more about this by going to ‘fund my healing journey …’ page.

* funding update:

I am presently (2021) on a new NHS referral application and this has been approved for a 12 month timeframe, to be reviewed. I will close my funding page down if it is ever approved without a time limit.

That said, on occasion I may also bring to your attention petitions and / or go fund me pages that may ask for donations, which are nothing to do with me but I feel are important. You are under no obligation to donate to anyone or anything, unless you want to.

More importantly, what I will hopefully be doing though is making people aware of ME and the other related illnesses and I will also be encouraging you to share your knowledge around the condition with others. ME sufferers really need the wider population to understand and know what this illness entails.

The quote below, from an ME specialist, highlights the severity of illness symptoms we suffer:

“My H.I.V. patients for the most part are healthy and hearty thanks to three decades of intense and excellent research and billions of dollars invested. Many of my [ME] C.F.S. patients, on the other hand, are terribly ill and unable to work or care for their families. I split my clinical time between the two illnesses [AIDS and ME/CFS], and I can tell you if I had to choose between the two illnesses (in 2009) I would rather have H.I.V. Because C.F.S., which impacts a million (to 4 million) people in the United States alone, has had a small fraction of the research dollars directed towards it.” ~ Dr. Nancy Klimas, AIDS and CFS researcher and clinician, University of Miami

For me, the most poignant and telling part of the above quote is, if I had to choose between the two illnesses … I would rather have H.I.V. … I find this utterly shocking and also enlightening as to why I always feel like I am on deaths door …

How can that possibly be? Why would a specialist in HIV prefer to have the HIV illness over ME?

And this, my friend(s) and followers, is just what I would like to highlight here in my, sometimes very personal, pages.

So, please read, learn, and enjoy, and most importantly please share what you learn and make people more aware of ME. If want to start on ‘about me’ page and read my personal story in the fly out towards the bottom of that page, it is a good place to start. Feel free to contact me … with any suggestions or discussions. My email is always open, but please be aware it may take me a few days to respond.

Lots of love

Detransitioners and their gender critical allies feel vindicated by judicial recognition that treatment of children with puberty blockers is experimental and dangerous; trans activists characterise the decision as an attack on the fundamental rights of all trans people.

The Court’s decision

On the face of it, given the scope of the decision, both reactions are surprising. The court didn’t actually decide that Keira Bell had been rushed into treatment that she wasn’t able to understand, or order the Tavistock to pay her compensation for the permanent damage to her body caused by the treatment she received. It didn’t even order the Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS) at the Tavistock to stop treating children with puberty-blockers, or to change the information it gave them before it started treatment. What it decided was that teenagers under 16 will very rarely have capacity to give informed consent to treatment with puberty blockers, and children of 13 and under almost never. And that even in the case of young persons of 16 or 17, it may be necessary to seek court authorisation to proceed with treatment.

But children often receive medical treatment for which they lack capacity to give their own informed consent. An infant needing an operation can’t consent: its parents typically consent on its behalf. A child of primary school age may be able to argue more fluently than its parents would always wish, but still may not be equipped to weigh up the pros and cons of serious medical treatments. So what’s the big deal, if children lack capacity to consent to puberty blockers? Why can’t their parents just consent on their behalf, in the usual way?

The Tavistock’s policy

Paragraph 47 of the judgment quotes from a letter sent by the Tavistock’s lawyers in response to the initial threat of litigation:

Although the general law would permit parent(s) to consent on behalf of their child, GIDS has never administered, nor can it conceive of any situation where it would be appropriate to administer blockers on a patient without their consent.

In context, it is clear that they are not saying merely they wouldn’t administer blockers to a child who didn’t want them: but that they wouldn’t administer blockers except to a child who had capacity to consent on his or her own behalf to the treatment. In other words, the Tavistock’s own policy was (and is) that parental consent isn’t enough: the informed, effective consent of the child patient is required. That’s why the court’s decision that children will very rarely be able to give such consent matters so much: if the Tavistock won’t act on the basis of parental consent alone, then children won’t be treated unless either they can themselves validly consent, or a court decides that the treatment is in their best interests.

What’s special about treatment with puberty blockers?

The question I find interesting here isn’t really a legal question. It is this: what is it that’s special about treatment with puberty blockers that makes the Tavistock think that parental consent isn’t good enough? If a child needs a vaccination to reduce the risk of a potentially serious childhood disease, parental consent is good enough. If a child needs a filling to deal with tooth decay, or an extraction to deal with an overcrowded mouth, the same. If a child needs surgery to pin a broken bone, the same again.

Parental consent is good enough for most medical treatment because its necessity or desirability can be established by objective evidence. Tooth decay and broken bones can be seen with an x-ray; the risks of mumps, measles etc. (and the benefits of vaccination) are well-established by epidemiology. But if a child with the body of a girl says she is so sure that she is really a boy that she wants to be treated with puberty blockers to ensure that she doesn’t mature physically as a woman, there no blood test, no visible symptom, no scan, no x-ray that can confirm her condition. How are parents, teachers, therapists and doctors to know whether she is truly trans (assuming for the purposes of argument that there is such a thing – or if even if there isn’t, at least so intractably dysphoric that radical body modification offers her the best hope of a flourishing life); or temporarily caught up in a teenage craze; or expressing distress in response to childhood abuse, homophobic bullying at school, or a traumatic bereavement or abandonment, or the pervasive sexism and misogyny of the society in which she is growing up?

One might think that these were the kinds of difficult questions with which clinicians would grapple earnestly before agreeing to set children on a path to medical transition and lifelong patienthood. What’s going on here? What are the causes of this child’s dysphoria? What are her chances of growing out of it with natural puberty? If treated, what are the chances that she will later regret the treatment?

Astonishingly, one would be wrong. Even more astonishingly, it seems that the clinicians who have guided the development of the GIDS would not even regard these as valid questions. Bernadette Wren, Consultant Clinical Psychologist at the GIDS until her retirement in 2020, posed herself these questions in a 2014 paper:

Can ‘postmodern’ ideas about the non-ﬁxity and instability of gender serve the perplexed clinician? Can we forego the grounding of our ideas in demonstrable certainties? Operating with a postmodern notion of gender, can the clinician justify irreversible physical intervention? Thinking postmodern and practising in the enlightenment: Managing uncertainty in the treatment of children and adolescents, Feminism & Psychology 2014, Vol. 24(2) 271–291



In the abstract of the same paper, she writes:

In particular, how do we justify supporting trans youngsters to move towards treatment involving irreversible physical change, while ascribing to a highly tentative and provisional account of how we come to identify and live as gendered? I conclude that the meaning of trans rests on no demonstrable foundational truths but is constantly being shaped and re-shaped in our social world.

[emphasis supplied]

This is consistent with Wren’s understanding of postmodernism, of which she says:

It argues that we cannot properly speak of objective and universal truths because it recognises that we can never stand outside the conceptual frameworks we are trying to explain.

In a later article Debate: You can’t take politics out of the debate on gender-diverse children, Wren candidly admits that there is little reliable evidence to draw on when making decisions about the treatment of gender dysphoric children:

In this field of practice… studies are still few and limited in scope, at times contradictory or inconclusive on key questions. Professionals and families must navigate the options with limited reassurance about how to proceed in the face of changing and challengeable clinical evidence. Child and Adolescent Mental Health 25, No.1, 2020, pp.40-42



But that does not seem to her to be a reason not to give young people what they ask for:

[U]nder UK law, we have increasingly come to think that enabling young people to experience some forms of self-determining freedom is a social good (Alderson, 2017), an idea interlinked with the thesis that a measure of authentic self-knowledge can be achieved, even by children and adolescents. This is the permissive culture in which young people – including those who are gender diverse – may be allowed considerable freedom to make their own mistakes. Besides, young people today are entering an era of medical care when intervention on and into the body becomes increasingly commonplace. Twenty-first century medicine offers treatments that are supportive of identity projects as well as responsive to pathology. [emphasis supplied]

Alarming though this is, it does at least make perfect sense of the GIDS’ unwillingness to accept parental consent as a substitute for the young person’s consent when treating children or adolescents with puberty-blockers: to do so would be fundamentally at odds with the philosophical underpinnings of the service. Parental consent would be rendered acceptable by a firm evidence base for the treatment proposed. But puberty blockers are not provided because there is convincing clinical evidence that they are needed (or even likely) to alleviate distressing symptoms or effect a full or partial cure for a pathology: on the contrary, it is admitted that the evidence base for treatment is thin tending to non-existent. The conclusion to the 2014 article that “the meaning of trans rests on no demonstrable foundational truths” goes further, suggesting that even a search for such evidence would be misconceived. Instead, treatment is provided because children and young people – who should be enabled to experience self-determining freedom, including the freedom to make their own mistakes – ask for it.

No evidence of benefit

It makes an alarming kind of sense of something else, too. The court in Bell repeatedly expressed surprise at the Tavistock’s inability to provide evidence about the effects and outcomes of treatment with puberty blockers, noting – in particular – at paragraphs 23 and 24 that it hadn’t been provided with the results of a research study started some nine years earlier at the Tavistock, which it had requested but been told was unavailable because one of its authors had yet to respond to issues raised in the peer review process. On the face of things, that was quite extraordinary: the study was centrally relevant to the matters discussed in the judicial review, and even if it was still going through the lengthy process of peer-review and hadn’t been finalised for publication, it undoubtedly existed in a near-final form which could have been provided to the court had the Tavistock chosen to provide it. (It was finally published on the day the High Court’s judgment was handed down.)

But if the service was run by postmodernist-leaning clinicians who regarded “truth claims” with suspicion and saw their task not as relieving the suffering of patients with distressing pathologies, but instead as facilitating their young clients in the pursuit of identity projects, what use would they have for clinical evidence?

Friendly fire from the Good Law Project

The Good Law Project on its crowd-funding page Legal Defence Fund for Transgender Lives announces a proposed challenge to the Tavistock’s policy:

The Tavistock will be invited – or sought to be compelled – to review its position in relation to whether to accept parental consent. In practice success on this action would remove, in many or most cases, the practical barrier to reatment posed by the Bell decision.

If the Good Law Project gets the High Court’s permission to pursue this, the likely result will be that the Tavistock is forced to explain – in detail, and in public – the reasons why it “cannot conceive of any situation in which it would be appropriate to to administer blockers on a patient without their consent.” That will shine further light on the absence of any convincing evidential basis for these treatments, and on the startling philosophical underpinnings of the GIDS’ practice. It promises to be a bruising encounter for both parties.

Eleven years ago, at the start of March, Eddie was seriously ill, he was completely paralysed except for his eyelids, he could only communicate by blinking and his prognosis was not good. On the day we all returned from Dubai I was asked by the Dr what I wanted to happen if Eddie had another stroke or heart attack. I knew that what he was asking was do we resuscitate or not. My reply was “This is a man who walked up mountains” his consultant reply was “Well he won’t walk up mountains again”. How do you make the decision I was being asked to make. How do you sit with one of your children beside you and condemn him, the person you love most in the world, to death. From all that had already happened I felt drained, unable to make simple decisions like having a shower or what clothes to wear and here was this man asking me to make the hardest decision of my whole life. What went through my head was totally, totally selfish. I thought of my future caring for someone who was totally paralysed. He couldn’t stay in hospital forever. Our tiny home would become a hospital with me as the main carer. How could I possibly do it. At that moment I couldn’t. My thoughts then turned to Eddie, action man. A man who loved adventure, camping on the snow line in winter, skiing, canoeing, climbing, cycling, laughing, loving. And I said “he wouldn’t want to live like this” and in my head I said “and neither would I.” In the weeks that followed I was in a very dark place and we as a family even considered a trip to Dignitas. However(my favourite word) if you have read the rest of Eddie’s blog you will know that Eddie’s recovery has been nothing short of miraculous. He can walk a few steps inside despite being in pain. He has been on holidays with The Calvert Trust where he is assisted to do many of the activities he did pre -stroke. Stroke recovery is unpredictable and doctors have to work with that and manage peoples expectations but, happily, His got it wrong because in 2013, with a team around him, Eddie walked up the last 500 metres of Mam Tor in Derbyshire. A journey that normally takes 20 minutes took him 3 hours, but he did it. In March 2011, during a call from Eddies cousin Marcin in Poland, he told me of an old Polish saying “The last thing I will give up is HOPE”. You may be reading this simply out of interest but you may be reading this as someone for whom the future seems very dark. My prayer for you is that you hear the still small voice whispering hope. Soft as the voice of an angel

Breathing a lesson unheard

Hope with a gentle persuasion

Whispers a comforting word Wait, till the darkness is over

Wait, till the tempest is done

Hope, for the sunshine tomorrow

After the darkness is gone Whispering hope

Oh how welcome Thy voice

Making my heart

In its sorrow rejoice If in the dusk of the twilight

Dimmed be the region afar

Will not the deepening darkness

Brighten the glittering star? Then, when the night is upon us

Why should the heart sink away?

When the dark midnight is over

Watch for the breaking of day Whispering hope

Oh how welcome Thy voice

Making my heart

In its sorrow rejoice Jeannie Pleban 03/03/22 Ten years ago today 06.02.11 I had my stroke. 11 years ago today I had my stroke, after all the bleak outcomes the medical world gave me and my family I'm still here and fighting fit, well sort of, here is to the nex 20 years. INTRODUCTION My latest painting. See my art page for further photos. As the title suggests I am a stroke survivor not a stroke victim, this blog is a story of my journey since February 6th 2011 starting with an account of my time in hospital and of my time in Rehab then my on going recovery at home, it is intended to encourage both stroke Survivors and Carers alike.

I was planning to write a book, however,there are many out there and as I don't wish to make any money out of my story which may prevent some from experiencing Gods Glory and healing powers I have chosen this media as the format for showing the world what its like to be a survivor relying on the Blessings of God, family and for support.

My web name comes from my friends on the 'Different Strokes' face book they nick named me Bantam Eddie because of the three young bantam chickens that have came into my life, sadley I had to give them up but, i kept my blog name.

I dedicate this story to my wife and family who loved and supported me though the most horrifying time of our life, to my friends who prayed for us throughout my recovery and still do, to the medical staff and flight crew who worked effortlessly to save my life and to the rehab team for the work they did and are still dedicated to my recovery and to God who intervened and rescued me from death itself and carried me through the trauma of recovering from a brain stem stroke. ACCEPTANCE France ACCEPTANCE. I know that many Stroke Survivors, carers and loved ones were told or were warned by consultants and other professionals in the early days of stroke that “you may never walk, talk, swallow “etc. these days I've come to understand why, if we were told that we will fully recover when knowing that we wouldn't would be foolish and dishonest of the practitioners. I like many others was given a bleak outlook for my future and to be prepared for a life with disabilities which caused me to be very sad and down for a short while, eventually I began to accept my stroke and the disabilities it has left me with, however, I could not and would not accept the prognosis. Let me try to encourage you by saying there is a new world out there to discover, though I cannot drive any more and my walking is ver poor I see and visit more places than I would have if I driving. over the years I've climbed my mountain, carried the Olympic torch, flown back to Australia, I independently travel in my Power chair on busses and trains, stay in hotels, visited many places in the Uk i.e. London, Newmarket, Stratford, the Lake Distric, Keilder Forres, Exmouth and many more places. Life doesn't need to be just an existence it's an exploration there are so many things out there that can give you something to live for and enjoy. Try not to allow yourself to get stuck in in that “I’ll never be able to do that again” mode, it isn’t an easy journey but the World is your Oyster so get out there and explore it. ........................................... My very first ride on a horse,ever you can tell its not going to by favourite activity. Further photos and thoughts on Eddies the dare devil page. A ride on the wild side, THERE IS LIFE AFTER STROKE, ITS DIFFERENT, BUT, ITS GOOD. NEW PAGES - 'EDDIES INDEPENDENT TRAVELS 'AND 'EDDIE THE DARE DEVIL' EDDIES INDEPENDENT TRAVEL I am aware that some power or manual chair users have needs that affect their ability to travel alone, however I hope to show carers and loved ones that all the places that are accessible to me will be accessible to you as an escort.

This page is about my journeys in my power chair or scooter. I often hear that getting about in a power chair can be difficult, some times it is depending where you are i.e. town, city, country side or country.

Again this section is pictorial and shows that someone in a chair can travel where ever they like.

ENJOY Rockingham beach WA You can see our latest Trip to Australia where I took my own power chair Eddies independent travel. SEPTEMBER 2014 at the base of Canigou, South France. One of the best days of my life, for years now I have wanted to climb Canigou in the South of France, as you know my stroke has put pay to this kind of extreme climbing, however, I managed to get to the base in what can be still described as extreme. Watch this. 31.07.2014 I feel rather pleased with myself, I've just cut the grass with only three rest pauses and I didn't drag my chair behind me. Reflection I am sitting here in the conservatory enjoying the sun shine and blue sky's yes blue sky's the storm has passed, but, while thinking it came back to me the memories of lying there unable to move the seconds, minutes, hours, days months yes months six in all, having my bum cleaned by young ladies, unable to eat, drink, talk, couldn't ring the bell when in pain, staff talking over you when cleaning you, staff not taking the time to learn to use the ETRAN communication board, being hoisted, rolled, meds stuck up your bum, blood taken daily and from anywhere they could find a vein etc. but like I said I am now sitting enjoying the sun and life in general waiting to go to McDonalds with grand daughter.</p> Every mans Tonka toy dream. From being told that I may never walk, talk, swallow etc again, here I am fulfilling a dream in Australia with my grandchildren. Sitting in the drivers seat of the truck"

I made it to my GP who gave me antibiotics in case it was an infection, and increased my pain meds.
Once at A&E I was triaged pretty quickly and given some much needed pain relief before waiting for blood tests, anti-nausea medication and to be assessed by a doctor.
I had to have a CT scan before I was discharged at 2:30am with more antibiotics, anti-nausea tablets and very strong pain relief.
Thankfully almost 3 weeks on and it’s a lot, lot better than it was although I am still sore even with pain relief and having to be very careful.","relief, wasnt, say, smiling, stent, pain, clare, parents, weeks, surgery, lot, week","Well it’s been a dramatic few months, from moving into my flat fully on ME Awareness Day, having my stent removed a week later, landing in A&E at the end of May, to finally having much needed major surgery at the beginning of June and more drama in between!

So it’s safe to say it’s been a while – the last time I blogged I was just about to move in to my flat, and now unbelievably I’ve been here four months, and to say things haven’t quite gone to plan would be an understatement.

The move itself went smoothly, but unsurprisingly I crashed 24 hours afterwards and one of my parents had to come to stay with me for a few nights. Four days on from that crash I had to have my ureteral stent removed ready for major surgery 3 weeks later. That went well, although within a week I was getting a lot of kidney pain, so much so I needed someone to stay with me again.

Fast forward a week to the end of May, and the pain was unbearable. I made it to my GP who gave me antibiotics in case it was an infection, and increased my pain meds. However that evening it became a lot worse and I was unable to eat or take the meds as the pain was so severe it was making me physically sick. My Mum rang NHS 111 while I lay on my bed struggling to stay conscious because the pain was so bad. They wanted to send an ambulance, however ambulance control said it was going to take 6 hours or more for an ambulance to arrive so it would be best if we could get me into the car and get me there ourselves. How my parents did that I do not know, I can remember screaming/groaning, feeling sick and dizzy with every slight movement as I got into my wheelchair, every bump in the path or road and when getting in/out the car! That felt like the longest journey ever.

Once at A&E I was triaged pretty quickly and given some much needed pain relief before waiting for blood tests, anti-nausea medication and to be assessed by a doctor. I had to have a CT scan before I was discharged at 2:30am with more antibiotics, anti-nausea tablets and very strong pain relief. They concluded I had a slight infection but ultimately it was just a case of my kidney failing to drain now the stent was out. So all they could do was try to manage my pain until my surgery date the following week and they’d rather do that at home than in hospital. Although I was made to promise I would keep that all important appointment the following week – to be at Theatre Admissions by 07:30am – to be honest it wasn’t much of a decision to make as it was the only way to get rid of this unimaginable pain!

The morning of June 8th was possibly the most nerve-wracking of my life. Waiting to go down to theatre on my own, with the words of the anaesthetist going round my head – “if your heart rate or blood pressure become too unstable and we’re unable to stabilise them we might have to abandon the surgery” – everything was a bit of an unknown as it was my first ever major surgery, and we didn’t know quite how my faulty autonomic nervous system would cope.

As it turns out it has surprised us all and coped a lot better both during and after the surgery than any of us expected. My surgeon found a “big fat artery” crossing my left ureter, virtually crushing it which is why my kidney wasn’t draining without the stent holding it open. He rerouted my ureter around the artery to resolve the issue.

The first words I remember saying when I came round are “Did it go ok?” – I had been so worried they might have to abandon the surgery after seeing the anaesthetist that morning, it was such a relief to hear them say it had gone to plan!

Now comes for the surprise bit – I stayed in recovery for quite a while as they couldn’t find me a bed on a ward until the evening, but not overnight like the team had expected because my blood pressure, heart rate etc were all stable.

I was moved to a ward in the evening, and my parents came to visit for a short time which was lovely. And I managed to get some sleep overnight as well – the pain from surgery was a lot less than it had been in the week leading up to it! Whether that was because it was better managed or just because the pain had been so severe prior to it I don’t know. The next morning my surgeon came to see me and his first words were “You’re looking well, I think as long as the catheter and drain come out okay, you can go home today”.

And everything did go okay. The only delay was waiting for my prescription of strong pain meds and blood thinning injections to arrive on the ward so I could be discharged. That was a painful wait as well because it was so long I was due more pain relief but the ward couldn’t give me anything because my medication card had been sent to pharmacy to fill the prescription! But it still wasn’t anything like the pain I was in before having the surgery.

So began my recovery at home. The first week was a bit of a rollercoaster, with little things causing big worries because we weren’t entirely sure what was normal and what wasn’t, and of course being discharged on a Friday evening there wasn’t a lot of support available over the weekend either! But we got through okay, and as I say my body has handled it all much better than we expected.

Fast forward to seven weeks post-op and I returned to hospital to have my stent out under local anaesthetic. That went smoothly – a lot more smoothly (and less painful) than the previous one! And so far, now 6 weeks on from that I am still doing well. My parents have been amazing, taking it in turns staying with me for the seven weeks while I recovered from surgery and wasn’t allowed to do a lot of things.

11 weeks post-op and we had another dramatic day, this time something just gave in my hip as I got up from my sofa on a Saturday night – the first night my parents had gone out to a party in a long time – I managed through the night but had to call on my Mum to help me out of bed the next morning because every move was agony. And once again I ended up in A&E in my pyjamas, only this time it was by ambulance! X-rays showed my hip joint itself was fine, so they suspected I had torn a muscle. I was discharged in the afternoon on pain relief and my parents once again took turns staying with me until I was able to get up out of bed on my own and didn’t need a walking frame to get around. Thankfully almost 3 weeks on and it’s a lot, lot better than it was although I am still sore even with pain relief and having to be very careful.

So all in all this year has definitely been a dramatic one so far – I can’t believe it’s September already! – in many ways things have been a lot easier than expected. But that’s not to say this hasn’t been hard on my body – it really has – however I’ve not felt anywhere near as rough as I expected to and for the most part my symptoms from my chronic illnesses haven’t been as bad as expected either. There have been tough days, and everything is very much a very careful balancing act of pacing right now. It doesn’t take a lot to push me from a “manageable day” to “overdoing it”, so it all has to be carefully planned. But I’m getting there, and that’s the main thing. Hopefully now things will settle down and I might be able to get back to blogging a bit more (this post has been in the making since the beginning of July so it might still be slow going!)"

168084,https://memysefandchronicillness.home.blog/,A blog written by a person living with several chronic illnesses.,True,"Me, Myself and Chronic Illness Blog","Before we go any further let me issue a TW as the following talks about mental health and fertility/not having children.
For how long for I cannot say, but hopefully today will be the start of getting back into the swing of things.
Quite a bold statement considering I live with multiple chronic illnesses, but it is true.
I say this because I have grieved many times for my life with regards to chronic illness (which took me a hella long time) and I thought I was past it.
Well, you lovely people I’ve done it – an actual blog post!!","chronic, say, life, things, think, really, thought, probably, illness, blog, long, topics, moving","Well, where do I even start? I guess hello, how are you would be a great intro. It is mad I have come back after all this time away and it feels like I cannot even remember how to formulate a post. So bear with me, if things go a bit awry.

Before we go any further let me issue a TW as the following talks about mental health and fertility/not having children. Please refrain from reading if this is not a suitable subject for you at this time.

It has been a long old time, but I am eventually back. For how long for I cannot say, but hopefully today will be the start of getting back into the swing of things. So where have I been, and why have I been gone for so long? What can I say other than the last four months – actually the last eight months – no in fact 2022 has probably been one of the hardest periods of my life. Quite a bold statement considering I live with multiple chronic illnesses, but it is true.

You know how you have a row of dominos, and you push one and watch the others fall one after another, it has been a bit like that. Just one thing after another with no respite. It started with the stress of moving (which then never happened), and having to recover from the mental and physical strain this put on my mind and body, and believe me when people say moving it is one of the most stressful things you can do they aren’t lying. This was then followed by the unexpected passing of a family friend, then family issues and this was alongside my health being at an all time low. I am happy to say I finally have an appointment for an undiagnosed issue I have and I am hoping this is going to get me on track and give me some sense of control.

In addition to this, the last year has brought up a lot of deep rooted worries I have regarding being disabled and living with the types of conditions I have. All of which has put me in a dark place mentally. Issues such as being a burden, fears for my future, feeling left behind and the ever-growing realisation that I will probably never become a mother. These topics are things I would definitely love to write about in more detail in separate posts as there is so much to it and they are interwoven with many different elements.

I guess you could say I have been grieving in some ways. Which saddens me and angers me all in one go. I say this because I have grieved many times for my life with regards to chronic illness (which took me a hella long time) and I thought I was past it. But I realise now that my grief periods before were all for separate topics – although entwined. Firstly I grieved for the life I had before becoming ill, and the life I had planned, and the second time it was for the loss of my career due to illness. Trust me when I say I went through every stage imaginable – anger, denial, bargaining, depression and finally acceptance. Like I said I thought I was over it now – that I had accepted my life wont be the same or how I had hoped, that my career or in fact my ability to work full stop had to be sacrificed in order to just survive each day.

I wrongly believed when I grieved, I had mourned for everything my conditions had taken from me and then 2022 happened. Last year was the year that both my siblings became parents. One has a baby and the other is about to . Last year was also the year I found out that due to a multitude of reasons including health, fertility, age, lack of partner and medication this is looking less and less likely to be in my future. I was even told that in the off chance there was a slight possibility I should consider freezing my eggs like asap. Able bodied people really do not have a clue when it comes to the bank balance of a disabled person on benefits, do they? I couldn’t even dream of getting that type of money especially when there are no guarantees it would work.

Even without these million and one obstacles, I got thinking. Could I look after a child? On my own or otherwise? And the honest answer is no, I don’t think I could. Don’t get me wrong there are many many disabled and chronically ill people that have children and thrive, but with my particular symptoms in my particular body with my set of circumstances, I would struggle. That’s when the reality hit me and the heartache began, and it hasn’t really stopped. It doesn’t help that it is baby chat central in my life right now either.

So, what am I doing about it? I have spoken before about new years resolutions and how they are not my bag, but setting goals is an alternative. You can read my article here on the pros and pressures of goal setting if you missed it. Nothing crazy mind, just slow and steady. Right now I am just doing little bits in each area of my life which makes me feel like I am moving forward. Because I think that is the key – moving forward and having a focus in my own world so I stop being getting caught up in others.

I think if there is anything I want from 2023 it is this – to reconnect with who I am and what makes me truly happy. To find peace. And I guess I’d love to take you guys along for the ride.

Like I said earlier, some topics I would like to talk about further mainly to get them out of my own head, but I also want to get back to doing things that act as distractions. Book reviews here we come! Part of me thought about making a second blog to do those types of bits and bobs on, but I thought no this has always been a bit of a jumble so why change it – it either takes your fancy or not, if not move onto something that does. I won’t be offended.

I am probably going to wrap up now, but I would like to say a massive thank you to anyone who has continued to visit my site since my break and who has shared any of my work on social media. I am truly grateful. I know I have some comments I haven’t responded to purely because I haven’t logged on here in so long – I will get to them, better late than never. Speaking of socials I was surprised by how much it has changed recently. Not sure I really need to see how many people have seen my tweets and scrolled on past – but there you go.

As I do not have a set timetable of when I am blogging yet, it is a go with the flow, how I feel on any given day kind of vibe, make sure to give me a follow if you want to keep updated with any new stuff.

Well, you lovely people I’ve done it – an actual blog post!! Party poppers at the ready! Or perhaps I will just go and have a much needed rest with a hot water bottle.

Until next time, stay safe

Hopefully as more research is done more is understood about EDS and therefore treatments and the diagnosing of EDS will improve.","eds, girl, joint, called, condition, pain, reduce, things, brace, affects, body, help, naomi","This is an EDS joke and I mean it quite literally. Having EDS (Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome) means that among other symptoms my joints easily sublux and dislocate. Even the slightest wrong move or hyperextention that wouldn’t be too disastrous to most people, for those like me with EDS can really be a bad move too much. We’re mostly used to just popping our joints back in which would make most people scream and cringe simultaneously but occasionally a trip to the ED is required if the dislocation is stubborn, severe, or there is damage.

EDS is a hereditary condition that affects the connective tissue - basically the glue of the body so it affects the joints, organs, skin, ligaments - pretty much everything. There are 13 different types of EDS each have a different characteristics as well as a genetic marker apart from hypermobile EDS which researchers are still looking the genetic marker for. I had genetic testing as it was originally suspected that I may have vascular EDS but that came back negative so I was diagnosed with hypermobile EDS (hEDS) but I still have some features of vEDS.

Zebras represent the condition as EDS is classed as a rare illness. The reason behind the zebra is because doctors are taught “when you hear hoof beats think horses not zebras” meaning look for the most common cause first but of course like zebras rare things exist too.

Fact: did you know a group of zebras are called a dazzle!

It often takes those with the condition many years to get a diagnosis. Once I was diagnosed I could see all the signs of my EDS being there in my life way back to childhood when my hypermobility made me a great ballet dancer but I had to give up dancing because of my hyperlordosis (an acute inward curvature of the lower spine) which I now see was a sign of my EDS back them. As well as how all my complaints of joint pain were put down to just simple ‘growing pain’ and other little signs and symptoms of my EDS being there all along. I think now though however EDS is getting a little more recognition so hopefully my collective missed opportunities wouldn’t happen again today if I had seen at least one professional who knew about EDS.

My skin is alsomore fragile so I’m more susceptible to injury so I’m always covered in marks and bruises. Activity in terms of movements have to be done carefully due to the high risk of injury including causing a joint to sublux (partly dislocate) or dislocate. EDS also affects the organs; for me it’s left me in bladder failure so I have a surgically placed catheter, which has greatly improved my quality of life even though it is difficult having a catheter to manage. EDS also affects my heart and gastrointestinal system (which can develop into secondary conditions). Another co-morbidity/symptom of EDS is dysautonomia which can lead to developing conditions like POTS - Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (this is also linked to my M.E. too).

To brace or not to brace is the question. Braces can be useful but the joint can get reliant and lose ability if a brace is over used. Generally it’s what’s been prescribed. For me I generally wear my splints and braces post dislocation or if a joint is feeling a bit unstable and in need of support, especially my thumb so my most commonly worn brace is my CMC thumb brace. Some parts of the body are harder or impossible to brace; you can get tape but it’s something I’ve not tried. My shoulders are the worst for this as they frequently dislocate/sublux but you can’t brace a shoulder and wearing a sling isn’t practical.

Living with EDS can be really difficult, and tricky. It takes careful management to pace your day to help reduce fatigue and pain. Aids/gadgets help to make life easier. According to my best friend I’m the gadget queen! I find aids so helpful from hands free can openers, adapted knives and scissors, perching stool, PopSockets and phone holders to body pillows (and everything in between) which all help to reduce dislocations/subluxations, make things easier to handle or reduce fatigue, reduce aches and more. I also find other equipment helps me too like my profiling bed, and because my EDS makes me more susceptible to pressure sores I have an airflow mattress; I also have a bath lift. Learning to pace is important too. I also find staying mobile helps even if it is difficult but at the same time accepting and embracing the use of mobility aids I use both crutches or a wheelchair - these help me immensely; I can only manage short distances and weight bearing with my EDS causes me a lot of pain especially in my hips so mobility aids help a lot.

Pain is a big aspect of having EDS. The pain covers your whole body; you get the muscular-skeletal pain but then I also have my bladder pain and my gastrointestinal pain too. The pain can feel pretty relentless; there are no days off from it. Some days are better than others but it’s always there. Meds and other things help, I’ve tried lots of things, some things help better than others. Mindfulness, heat, distraction, movement, massage, TENS machines/pens. I also find that my symptoms like my pain have a domino effect upon my other illnesses and they bounce off one another. Like if my hip pain is bad my M.E. leg pain might flare up. Pain relief medication only does so much too; like in the name it only gives you relief and takes the edge off the pain but it doesn’t take it away it just makes the pain just about tolerable and manageable so I can just about function and have some sort of quality of life.

I wish my EDS had been pick up sooner when I was a child. It’s slowly getting more recognition but more is needed. It often depends upon where you live, locally very few professional's here know much about EDS but in London where my care is so much more is known about the condition. Hopefully as more research is done more is understood about EDS and therefore treatments and the diagnosing of EDS will improve."

Hyperalgesia – increased sensitivity to pain – is a result of loss of sleep, especially the loss of REM sleep.
Which is ironic, because the opioid drugs used to treat severe pain suppress REM sleep and may make patients more sensitive to the pain they feel.
PAIN DURING REM SLEEP…People have reported pain during their dreams that isn’t real pain – it’s dream pain – and vanishes when they awake.","noise, night, stage, pain, does, rem, uk, sleep, blog, dreams, patients, quality","It’s estimated that 50-80% of chronic pain patients report sleep disturbances. The worst is when pain and sleep loss get into a downward spiral of awfulness, leading to a low quality of life. Pain makes it hard to sleep, poor sleep makes the pain subjectively worse, and both lead to depression, which also affects sleep disorders and pain experience. Cognitive behavioural therapy is a possible solution for both living with pain and alleviating problem sleep.

Pain medication has a profound influence on sleep, even aside from its analgesic effects. Opioids fragment the sleep cycle, even though it may subjectively seem to the patient that the sleep is better, at least in the short run. Over-the-counter pain meds like ibuprofen and aspirin also affect the sleep cycle, although not to the same extent. The effect is not uniformly bad, of course, if the pain medication lets the person get to sleep. They put me on Nortriptyline to help me sleep but I must admit I do also take a couple of herbal relaxants as well. It was mentioned at my last pain meeting that maybe I should try and come off the Nortriptyline as it does have some nasty side effects. I had more important drugs to cut down on (Tramadol) so I left this for a later date. By accident, I completely forgot to take them one-night last week and I had the worst pain and slept very little so I am in no rush to change my routine on what I take to help me sleep.

They say people with insomnia are more likely to have chronic pain than those without. Experts estimate 25-40% of patients with chronic pain have insomnia, many times the rate among those without. Does pain make the sleep worse or does poor quality sleep degrade make the pain feel worse? Both. Don’t discount the effect that a good night’s sleep can have on a person’s quality of life and ability to tolerate pain. The subjective intensity of pain decreases when a person is well-rested. Hyperalgesia – increased sensitivity to pain – is a result of loss of sleep, especially the loss of REM sleep. Which is ironic, because the opioid drugs used to treat severe pain suppress REM sleep and may make patients more sensitive to the pain they feel. Antidepressant drugs also suppress REM sleep and make us complain about pain more (maybe this is partly the cause of the stereotype of the diva). Poor sleep quality is correlated with more severe pain and increased fatigue.

Rheumatoid arthritis patients complain about sleep problems often and the sleep difficulty and the pain support each other in a vicious cycle. It’s well known there is a connection between pain and mood. And between depression and sleep disorders. Researchers studied arthritis patients using the HAQ-pain scale, the Beck Depression Inventory-II, the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form – 36 vitality scale for fatigue, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index for sleep quality and disturbances. They found that poor sleep quality was correlated with disability in arthritis patients

Scientific article: Sleep Quality and Functional Disability in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis

Lower back pain as I know only too well is known to affect sleep, both the quality and sleep latency. The Mayo Clinic website has interesting pictures of sleeping positions that may help reduce back pain. Recognizing that pain and sleep disorders often go hand-in-hand, the pharmaceutical companies have introduced combination drugs– over-the-counter pills that include both an aid (an antihistamine) and an analgesic.

The topic of pain and sleep is tied closely to that of ageing and sleep. A much higher percentage of seniors experience chronic pain than young and middle-aged adults. A much higher percentage of seniors experience sleep disorders, too.

PAIN DURING REM SLEEP…

People have reported pain during their dreams that isn’t real pain – it’s dream pain – and vanishes when they awake. More common is real bodily pain that could be felt if the person was awake but which was incorporated into the narrative of the dream. Vivid narrative dreams happen when the brain is in REM sleep and during REM the skeletal muscles are paralyzed. This paralysis may contribute to bodily pain and make it worse than in NREM sleep when the body can more easily move around.

Psychologists did a test where they induced a mild pain in sleepers in the REM stage of sleep. Upon awakening, the subjects often reported dreams (about 30%) that included pain in the same part of the body that the researchers applied pressure to. The subjective level of pain during the dream tended to be higher than the pain when the person was awake. Curiously, burn patients report about the same percentage of pain dreams even though the level of pain they experience is much higher than the subjects in the psychologists’ tests.

NOISE AND SLEEP…

Loud or unpredictable noises fracture sleepers’ rest, sometimes causing awakening, and sometimes triggering a shift to a different stage of sleep. The noise that disrupts slow-wave sleep leaves people waking to feel unrefreshed and often with diffuse pain and tenderness, even in healthy people. I can honestly say that I am quite sure I can even hear a pin drop.

Individuals have different responses to noise, of course. Researchers have even figured out how to predict who will wake up from noises, based on electroencephalography (EEG) readings. People who have more sleep spindles on the EEG readings during a normal night of sleep have more tolerance for noise. In other words, people who have more active brains when asleep tend to sleep better when it is noisy.

White noise – a constant hum in the background at low volumes – can help some people sleep. Presumably, this is because the noise drowns out softer unpredictable sounds. There are commercial products that generate white noise that some find helpful and others use humidifiers partly because of their constant hum. White noise can induce sleep in infants.

Rain helps improve the subjective quality of sleep for many. You have probably heard people tell you they slept great because of the rain. This may be due to a combination of the white noise generated during the rain (but not in a thunderstorm), a sudden reduction in outdoor temperature, changes in the electrostatic characteristics of the air. Further, the “fresh” air following rain – perception of coolness, sweet smelling air, low particulate account – is conducive to sleep.

Aircraft noise disturbs sleep and when bad enough can result in sleep-deprived behaviour during the day. The WHO claims 1 in 3 Europeans suffers health harm from excessive traffic noise (cars, planes, etc.). 20% of Europeans are said to be at risk for significant health damage from nighttime noise. A Korean study found railway traffic was more bothersome and problematic for sleepers than automobile traffic.

What about birdsong and the natural sounds of the morning? Many find these sounds pleasant when they are relaxed and report they enhance the sleep experiences around dawn when the sleeper is often in REM sleep.

A related issue is the effect of rocking on sleep. Parents rock babies to sleep and some baby cribs are set to rock. People enjoy sleeping in hammocks that can rock. Is there the scientific explanation of that? A Swiss study found the rocking at 0.25 Hz facilitates and transition from stage 1 to stage 2 sleep. The density shown on EEG reports increases when the sleeper is rocking.

THE SOUND SLEEPER…

What does it mean to say someone is a sound sleeper? Or that you slept soundly? One thing it means is that the sleeper does not wake readily from noises. “Resistance to acoustic disturbance” is a measure of the depth of sleep, and it varies over the course of the night. How likely we are to wake up from sleep in response to noise varies throughout the night and even within any given stage of sleep. In deep sleep, we are less apt to be awakened from external noise. Spindle activity in light sleep seems to be a measure of how sound (less sensitive to sounds) we are.

REM SLEEP…

Very Well Health writes that Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is one of the two recognized types of sleep. It is differentiated from non-REM sleep by vivid dreams, paralysis of most of the body’s muscles, and preserved movement of the eyes and diaphragm. It occurs at intervals of 90 to 120 minutes throughout the night and becomes more prolonged towards morning.

The last third of the night often has an increased presence of REM sleep and it is common to wake from it in the morning. A healthy young adult will spend about 20% to 25% of the night in REM sleep and it occurs in four to six discrete episodes.1﻿﻿ It is important formemory processing and problem-solving."

This article guides you through the jungle, so you can avoid the harmful ingredients and find a non toxic sunscreen.

Chemical Free, Mineral... A few Definitions

It’s important to address what we class as a ‘chemical’. There is maybe a misconception that all chemicals are harmful – they’re not. We (and everything around us) are made up of them; nothing is truly “chemical free”. So instead of searching for a chemical free sunscreen, we're talking about a non toxic sunscreen i.e. one that is free from harmful chemicals.

And if we say ‘chemical’ sun screens, we mean the synthetic chemical filters (like oxybenzone) rather than the physical or mineral filters (like zinc oxide or titanium dioxide).

What are the harmful ingredients in sunscreen?

This table has a list of all the ingredients you might want to avoid and why:

1. Ingredients linked to reproductive Issues

Chemical sunscreens have been linked to reproductive issues because of the hormone-mimicing effects of some of the ingredients. The chemical homosalate, for example, has been linked to interference with sperm function (Rehfeld 2016). Niels Skakkebaek, a senior investigator in the study of the effects of homosalate says, ”These results are of concern and might explain in part why unexplained infertility is so prevalent”.

Using synthetic/chemical sunscreen during pregnancy is also a cause for concern. When chemicals or products are tested for their safety, they aren’t tested on pregnant women due to it being deemed unethical; however the ethical considerations of allowing a potentially harmful product to be used on pregnant women are swept to the side. Given the data that shows certain synthetic chemicals affect our reproductive health in other ways, it might be a good idea to avoid sunscreens with controversial chemicals and opt for something safer.

2. Ingredients that can irritate the skin

The reason we choose to apply sunscreen is to protect our skin, but some chemicals such as cinoxate and octocrylene are linked to skin irritation and photosensitivity (a reddening of the skin resembling sun burn) – a little ironic! If you are suffering with a skin condition, such as eczema, the best sun cream to use is one that is organic and as natural as possible.

3. Chemicals that aren't photostable

If a chemical is photo-unstable, it means its chemical structure can be changed under the influence of light, so sunscreen chemicals especially should be photostable. Avobenzone, a commonly used ingredient in synthetic sunscreen which, when broken down, can become unstable and toxic.

4. Environmentally damaging sun screens

Synthetic chemicals in sunscreen aren’t linked to health concerns alone. Ingredients like oxybenzone are also linked to negative environmental impacts including pollution, where evidence has revealed damage to coral reefs when this chemical is washed off of swimmers (NOAA 2015). But how much of this really ends up on coral reefs? Well, actually, up to 14,000 tones…each year. Not only are we searching for safe sunscreen for our health, but reef safe sunscreen to protect our environment.

So what about the physical / mineral sunscreens like zinc oxide and titanium dioxide?

Thankfully, physical sunscreens provide both effective sun protection and aren’t associated with the health concerns above.

In our opinion, physical ingredients (zinc oxide and titanium dioxide) are the safest sunscreens to choose from. Both of these minerals sit on top of the skin and reflect the UV rays away, rather than the chemical alternatives that absorb the UV light.

Zinc oxide in particular has a number of health benefits attributed to it, including soothing skin irritation and is great for coping with sunburn, it’s non comedogenic (it won’t clog your pores and contribute to acne), it’s antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and has been shown to improve elasticity in skin which improves the appearance of wrinkles.

Zinc oxide is considered to be a better form of sun protection than titanium dioxide because it protects against a larger proportion of UVA rays (in fact, it often provides even better UVA protection than the chemical sunscreens).

5. What About Nanoparticles?

Nanoparticles refer to particles less than 100 nanometers in size (1 nanometer is 1/100,000 the width of a human hair!). There are concerns about the effect of nanoparticles – particularly those used in anti-ageing products – being able to change our skin’s cells.

Sun creams sometimes use nano-sized zinc or titanium dioxide in order to avoid a whitening effect on the skin. However, we do not use nanoparticles in our products. Nanoparticles are prohibited by the Soil Association, they guarantee that the average particle size in sunscreen is 200nm. However, our certified non-nano formula offers the best of effectiveness and aesthetics – a sunscreen which is clinically proven to give broad spectrum UVA and UVB protection without whitening the skin.

So try a physical sunscreen to steer clear of synthetic, harmful sunscreen chemicals and take advantage of physical sunscreen benefits.

Want To Try Our Non Toxic Sunscreen?

A great natural chemical-free sunscreen is our organic, 100% Natural Non Toxic Sun Cream SPF30. It is extremely efficient at protecting you from UVB and UVA rays (its critical wavelength is an impressive 380!).

Patients are allocated following a process of immediate removal from a GP practice list, resulting from an incident involving the GP practice – usually on the practice premises – that has been reported to the police.

The scheme is set out in the PMS Directed Enhanced Services Directions,1 but different areas have introduced various versions of the scheme so the contractual arrangements and payments set out below will be specific to your area. You should be able to obtain a copy of your specification from your local LMC or offices of NHS England.

In our area, it is necessary to read and implement the specification and sign the contract. In some areas the service is commissioned, so practices are expected to write a tender document setting out how they intend to meet the specification.

How does it work?

Our practice, which for the purposes of the DES covers about 450,000 patients, is usually caring for between 30 and 50 patients under the scheme at any one time.

NHS England informs the practice when a new patient is being allocated, enabling it to register the patient on the clinical system and add the code that identifies them for the purposes of the DES, usually 91D (Violent Patient Scheme).

The code is required to enable quarterly searches of consultations with allocated patients. These quarterly consultation figures trigger the payments.

Currently NHS England pays a retainer of around £2,500 per year to the practice and £93.06 for each consultation with scheme patients. The consultation payment is the same for appointments, telephone consultations and home visits. EMIS has the capacity to search numbers of consultations for defined groups of patients; other systems will probably provide similar searches – ask for assistance from your IT team.

Dealing with new patients

Removal from the previous list often occurs before the allocation, so functions such as EMIS’s GP2GP does not work. This is unfortunate, as detailed clinical information can be invaluable. NHS England is aware of this issue and looking at a possible technical solution to have records stored in a national hosted repository.

An alternative is to contact the previous practice and request a summary; also request the previous practice prints out all computer records when sending paper records to Primary Care Support England.

Before the patient has their first contact by phone or face to face, a risk assessment is essential. It must be done by someone familiar with such assessments. Under-assessment puts staff at risk and over-assessment inappropriately raises staff anxieties and leads to overuse of resources. There are no specific general practice tools but a risk matrix helps to stratify the risk.2

Factors to take into account are: the event that led to removal, history of previous violence, significant mental illness (psychosis), anxiety and agitation and history of odd behaviour. You are looking for what might happen; for example violence toward a member of the team and the likelihood of it happening.

Then you will consider what steps you can take to reduce the impact. Risk assessments should be repeated after the first face-to-face consultation. For the great majority, risks lessen when the attendance and consultations are handled carefully.

Special security measures

Specifications vary, but having an alarm system is the main security consideration (along with some training and the risk assessments). A very small minority – around 1% – of patients may need to be managed in conjunction with NHS England under high-level security, for example with visits accompanied by police or other security personnel.

Security should, wherever possible, be discreet but effective, rather than overt. Some practices ask patients to sign behaviour contracts, although we have not found this useful. Patients likely to follow them don’t need them, and vice-versa.

Similarly, the use of security guards is contentious; their presence can potentially inflame situations. Some practices use security guards in plain clothes. If a significant event does occur, the practice must call the police as any practice would.

The working environment needs to be safe. Alarms are essential in consulting rooms and it is advisable to have two types: a silent alarm such as the ‘Big Red Button’ on EMIS that calls staff without the patient knowing, and a noisy alarm to inform everyone.

Plans need to be in place to ensure responses are adequate. The clinician should always sit closer to the door than the patient and ensure there are no potential weapons to hand for the patient to use – such as pens, paperweights or hot coffee.

Home visits are very rarely required. When they are, the risks must be re-assessed. Some visits can be done as any other. If there is moderate risk it may be better to take a colleague. For high-risk patients, the police are able to accompany the clinician. Be aware that it may take a few hours to set up a visit with the police.

Is any specific training required?

It is essential that staff are effectively trained in de-escalation (a set of behavioural approaches that can help to defuse hostile situations), although specific requirements for this seem to vary around the country. Many local areas have such training available as part of customer care.

That said, our best training came from a large retired police officer, with martial arts expertise, who asked the audience what they should do if someone came at them with a knife. As we puzzled over sophisticated, intelligent answers, he halted the discussion and simply said ‘run’. It was a lesson in keeping it simple.

Providing appropriate care

Care of these patients is the same as for any other patient. However, it is worth noting that the prevalence of mental health problems is substantially higher than in the general population with predominance of personality disorders and adult ADHD. You may want to discuss this with your local mental health trust to see if there are opportunities for a mental health worker to be allocated to your practice.

Staffing issues

Extra staffing may be required for the administration of the DES service delivery. We always require a minimum of two administrative staff to be available in the building. The administration is probably no more than four hours per quarter but dealing with extra needy patients and some of the training and support systems does take up time. A rough estimate of about 8 hours per week is reasonably accurate for a DES allocation of about 30-50 patients. In addition, there is some extra clinical time as the patients are generally more complex than average.

Staff support should be part of the daily routine. After an incident, support or debriefing is often needed. If a staff member is being picked on, implement a ban on the patient having any contact with employee for a month.

Hold regular staff meetings to discuss problem patients and their impact on the practice. In addition, most, but not all, patients respond to sitting down with the Practice Manager and senior GP partner to discuss unacceptable behaviour in the context of the practice giving, and the patient receiving, good health care.

How to ensure payment

At the end of each quarter, searches need to be completed to identify the number of patients registered under the DES in that quarter and the number of face-to-face and telephone appointments that have involved those patients. If your local service is commissioned, there may be other requirements and you may be able to claim for specific items including training and equipment.

At the end of month 12, if there have been no incidents requiring a call to the police, the patient can return to a practice in their locality. The patient can be deducted, and the DES code removed.

In our experience, only a handful of the hundreds of patients we have managed in the past 12 years of the DES have presented significant problems. For those few, we have worked with NHS England and other agencies to ensure the patients have good care and the practice is unaffected.

How it can benefit the practice

The payments do meet the cost of running the service, including both the administration and the management, and probably leave a small amount that can be used to help sustain the practice.

The benefit of the service in our practice has been to develop a workforce who are more mindful of the emotional needs of patients and more adept at understand patient behaviours. Locally we are acknowledged as a friendly practice with a very good team spirit. A proportion of the reputation comes from our willingness and ability to take on challenging patients.

One drawback is that there have been times when staff have realised we are becoming burnt out by demanding patients. However, we have learnt how to do a ‘reset’. We sit together, talk about what has been happening, what the problems are and what needs to change. Implementation of the solutions brings us back together and, curiously, seems to calm the patients as well as us.

Since lock down began we have been facilitating two coffee mornings per week for one hour at a time. These meetings have been open to anyone with a learning disability and Autism, and they have proved extremely successful in connecting us with many people who we didn’t know before.

The meetings are structured and are a mixture of fun and games, as well as talking about issues related to people with learning disabilities and self-advocacy. The meetings are a useful way to give out accessible information about a range of things, including government guidance on lockdown rules. The group usually stays online for a few hours after we leave, to continue chatting with each other. We have also been inviting people from the community into the meetings to do both fun things like art, magic and theatre but also to talk about issues affecting them like Health Watch.

Issues have been coming up in these meetings that revolve around care that people are receiving and we have been concerned that people are paying a lot of money for their acre per month and support is via phone calls rather than care companies using PPA to help people with things like cooking, cleaning and self-care.

In addition to this we have been making films with disabled people dialling in to talk to us about things that are happening to them. We have been posting the videos on our social media and Disability Sheffield You Tube site.

We feel that these have been vital in supporting people to have a voice during this difficult time and for people to feel more included in society. From the videos people have been invited onto radio to talk about issues that affect them also.

We have also been connecting with care homes as part of the #Right2Home campaign and also a piece of research that we are doing around care homes and self-advocacy. The group on ZOOM have been coming up with ideas and questions to ask people who live in care homes that we have set meetings up in the next few weeks with.

The idea of the meetings is to get an idea of how people who are living in care homes have a voice and what happens if they raise concerns about their care.

We have also been purchasing digital equipment for people who are very isolated and supporting them to connect to Zoom and other social networks.

We have also put a small team of people with learning disabilities together to connect to other people with a learning disability who are very isolated and are not able or do not wish to connect via video and the internet. This has worked well but it is a very labour intensive piece of work as the people doing the support also require a lot of support themselves.

Some of the other things we have been involved in is connecting with national organisations like Learning Disability England and Inclusion North. This has proved valuable in us learning about what other groups are doing and also a great way to share information and not to reinvent the wheel."

Since the start of the pandemic I have found myself in an interesting position. Before the pandemic I was considered an ‘official’ disabled person as I am incapable of work and claiming out of work benefits as well as getting disability benefits. However, things have changed ever so slightly since the pandemic started having an impact on daily life, which has had a dramatic impact on me.

The government has created a way to register as a vulnerable person, and have sent out letters to those who qualify. This is a very different list to those of us who are considered disabled people, despite there being some crossover, there are also a great deal of people who are considered disabled but not ‘vulnerable’ in this pandemic.

What this means in practice is that a lot of the informal, often hidden support I relied on has disappeared, taken off me in favour of those considered vulnerable. I am not trying to deny these people the support and care they really need, but simply highlighting that I fall through the gaps.

The biggest problem has been access to food

Pre-pandemic I relied on internet shopping, as so many disabled people do. A regular delivery of food that I can cook for myself was something that I took for granted. I remember the first week that the impact truly hit, and over half my shopping was missing. I was simply unable to get another slot. There were big signs on the website saying that slots had been reserved for elderly and vulnerable customers (if there were even any to get). I was faced with the prospect of having to go into a supermarket for my weekly shop for the first time in a long time. Social distancing and long queues make this job difficult for most people. For me it was incomprehensible and anxiety inducing. So I started to look at other options. The local council and other voluntary organisations were starting food parcels. Even Morrisons supermarket was doing an ‘essentials box’. A local company was doing veg and fruit boxes. However, none of this helped me at all. I am very limited on what I can safely do in the kitchen and need to be able to carefully plan my meals for the week. I can’t just leave it to chance, or rely on what I call a box of ingredients. Thankfully, after hours of checking each supermarket continuously I managed to get a food delivery, and it all arrived! But that was just one. I have tried my best to get as much canned and frozen food as I can, but there will come a time when that runs out and I am back to square one. I am hoping that restrictions ease or it becomes easier to get a food delivery when I next need one.

Public Transport

My other problem has been the restriction of public transport. At the moment most of the bus network is running on a reduced timetable, the local bus has gone from one bus every ten minutes to one an hour. As I can’t drive because of my impairment, this is incredibly disabling, making even a trip to the doctors or pharmacy all but impossible, despite only being 5 minutes away on the bus. I am scared of getting on the bus in fear of being confronted, or encountering people who don’t follow social distancing rules properly. The added worry of how dirty the bus is has contributed to my reluctance to use it. I am effectively isolated at home, without the support or recognition I need to sustain it. I needed to get my prescription the other day, so I rang the pharmacy who could only recommend the local council service. I rang them, but as I don’t have a letter, I am not entitled to their support. I had to find a kind person to get them for me.

I have to admit to some jealousy of how quickly and efficiently the programme for vulnerable people has been set up. I think I am not alone in my amazement at the scale of support that is all of a sudden available, when people like me have been asking for years to receive similar levels of support from various sources. I can only hope that some form of this remains post pandemic to continue to support those of us in society who remain in need.

I have done some research about being in the gaps and my current experience is resonating with my findings. As I don’t quite fit into one neat category or another, my needs are not met and it’s as if I don’t exist. Before the pandemic I fought hard for the right to be recognised as a disabled person, and to get the support and care I need. All of a sudden, without any relevant legislation change my situation has changed dramatically. I have lost the little recognition that I had and needed as a disabled person. Once again, if I need to get any adjustments made for me, I have to out myself as a disabled person, and start the process again, with no guarantee of success.

Disabled by the environment

I find myself in a position exemplified by the social model of disability, that I am not being disabled by my body but by the environment I occupy and attitudes towards disabled people in that environment. It seems there is the black and white perception that disabled people either have statutory support, or are not in need of it at all. There are many of us who fall between the gaps, living in the precarious space of informal and invisible support, that has currently stopped working."

“I am not gonna die of COVID-19, even if I get contaminated with it. This happens only to those who belong to the vulnerable groups, such as the disabled, those with underlying health conditions and the older”.

This was an utterance, often accompanied by a sigh of relief, that was commonly used when the panic around COVID-19 started spreading. Moreover, the daily announcement of deaths out of COVID-19 triggered two different reactions, depending on the group that the person who had passed away belonged to. If they belonged to the aforementioned groups, then their death ‘made sense’, it was an expected one. On the other hand, if it was a person that did not present any features of ‘vulnerability’ e.g. a young, healthy, able-bodied person, then their death came as a surprise; it was unexpected.

I was and still am very disturbed with both the above statement and reactions – what Liddiard (2020) refers to as ‘ontologically violent messages’ – partly because I have family members and friends who belong to these ‘vulnerable’ groups. It is worth clarifying that I am not frustrated on their behalf, but with the underlying meanings and implications of these messages, which affect my own people (and not only). I focus here on two implications in particular: 1) whose life/death matters and 2) the politics of vulnerability.

In her book Frames of War: When is life grievable? Butler (2009: 38) proposes that:

One way of posing the question of who ‘we’ are in these times of war is by asking whose lives are considered valuable, whose lives are mourned, and whose lives are considered ungrievable. We might think of war as dividing populations into those who are grievable and those who are not. An ungrievable life is one that cannot be mourned because it has never lived, that is, it has never counted as a life at all. We can see the division of the globe into grievable and ungrievable lives from the perspective of those who wage war in order to defend the lives of certain communities, and to defend them against the lives of others—even if it means taking those latter lives.

While Butler discusses grievable/ungrievable lives in the context of war -war has been used as metaphor to describe the current circumstances too-, it is worth considering whose lives (and deaths) are grievable/ungrievable in these times of the pandemic. As illustrated in the above messages, the deaths of those belonging to the ‘vulnerable’ groups were deemed natural and, hence, mattered less, in opposition to the deaths of people who were not vulnerable, and, therefore, their death was ‘unnatural’ and mattered more. A hierarchical division between valuable, grievable lives (and deaths) and invaluable, ungrievable lives (and deaths) is in place, with the former representing lives lived by the subject of neoliberal ableism (Goodley & Lawthom 2019) and the latter representing the state of ‘bare life’ through which disabled people are marginalised (Overboe, 2007; Reeve, 2009).

A central notion in these messages was vulnerability, since it functioned as an explanatory framework through which the deaths of those deemed vulnerable came to make sense. However, as Watts Belser (2020) maintained:

Here’s the other problem with vulnerability: Focusing our attention on the vulnerability of the body makes disabled people’s deaths seem inevitable. It obscures the social and political dimensions of risk. It lets us off the hook for the way we’ve built a world that makes certain people less likely to survive. […] These aren’t body problems. This is ableism in action, working hand in glove with capitalism and white supremacy.

This is what Tremain (2020) refers to as the ‘naturalisation of vulnerability’:

Vulnerability isn’t a characteristic that certain individuals possess or embody. Like disability, vulnerability is a naturalized apparatus of power that differentially produces subjects, materially, socially, politically, and relationally. In short, it is by and through the contingent apparatus of vulnerability and other apparatuses that certain members of the population are vulnerableized.

Not only are certain individuals and populations vulberableised, but through ‘vulnerabilisation’ they are rendered disposable (Runswick-Cole, Goodley and Liddiard, 2020). Who lives and who dies then during this pandemic is not just a matter of biology, but a fundamentally (bio)political matter."

Please note that I am not a doctor, so you should always seek medical advice from your paediatrician or medical professional if you have any concerns.

Raising children on a vegan or plant-based diet is a rewarding choice, offering numerous health and environmental benefits. However, it comes with unique challenges that requires careful planning to ensure a well-balanced diet for growing bodies. Here are some essential tips for vegan parents to help raise healthy, happy children on a plant-based diet.

1. Ensure Nutrient Variety

A key to a healthy vegan diet is variety which includes a wide range of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds. This approach ensures your child gets a diverse set of nutrients. Rotate through different foods to keep meals interesting and nutrient-rich, and to encourage kids to try new foods to expand their palates and nutritional intake.

2. Focus on Protein Sources

Protein is crucial for growing children. Vegan diets provide ample sources of protein. But it's important to include them in every meal. Consider beans, lentils, tofu, tempeh, seitan, quinoa, and edamame as regular staples. Combining different protein sources can ensure a complete amino acid profile, supporting healthy growth and development.

3. Monitor Key Nutrients

While a well-planned vegan can meet most nutritional needs, some nutrients require special attention. Vitamin B12, vitamin D, iron, calcium, and omega-3 fatty acids are vital for children’s development. Consider fortified foods or supplements if necessary. For example, fortified plant-based milk can be a good source of calcium and vitamin D, while flaxseeds or chia seeds offer omega -3s. Regularly consult with a paediatrician or dietitian to ensure your child is meeting their nutritional requirements.

4. Make Mealtime Fun

Kids are more likely to enjoy meals when they’re involved in the process. Encourage them to help with meal planning, grocery shopping, and cooking. This involvement not only makes them feel valued but also educates them about healthy eating. Use creative shapes, colours, and textures in meals to keep them visually appealing.

5. Address Social Challenges

Vegan children might face unique social challenges, especially when attending parties or school events where non-vegan foods are prevalent. Prepare your child for these situations by explaining your family’s dietary choices and providing them with snacks or meals to take along. Communicate with teachers and other parents to ensure there are vegan options available during events.

6. Stay Informed and Flexible

Nutrition science is continually evolving, so stay updated on the latest research and recommendations. Join vegan parenting groups for support, recipe ideas, and shared experiences. Flexibility is key - be open to adjusting your child’s diet based on their changing needs and preferences.

7. Lead by Example

Children learn by observing. As a vegan parent, set a positive example by enjoying a variety plant-based foods and maintaining a balanced lifestyle. Your enthusiasm for veganism will naturally influence your child’s attitude towards food and health.

Raising children on a plant-based diet can be a fulfilling journey for the entire family. With careful planning, creativity, and a supportive approach, vegan parenting can promote health, compassion, and environmental responsibility in your child’s life."

After marrying my partner of now 11 years, we tried for a baby and never had a positive pregnancy test. It felt pretty heartbreaking and gruelling having cycle after cycle with the same result. After lots of testing, I was diagnosed with PCOS and my husband also had low morphology (this was eventually improved through lifestyle changes, reducing heat and with supplements including lycopene, zinc and pine bark). Another year of supplements (myo-inositol and NAC in particular have worked well for me with PCOS), lifestyle changes and six rounds of letrozole passed with still no pregnancy, so we embarked on a round of IVF. Unfortunately, not only was this unsuccessful, but also ended with me being hospitalised with OHSS and internal bleeding (an extremely rare experience, I would not want to deter anyone from IVF!) We were devastated and things looked (and, to be honest, still do look) pretty bleak in terms of our chances of conception. So whilst I can’t offer advice on falling pregnant, and without wanting to sound cliched as I know how heartbreaking and cruel trying to conceive can be, I believe that doing your absolute best to not put your life on hold during this time and travelling, seeing friends and family and making make time to prioritise the relationship with your partner is such a huge help in protecting your mental health, as well as being really kind and gentle with yourself (this is not always easy!) I have tried pretty much every recommended supplement, monthly testing, old wives tales (legs in the air!) but I think coming to terms that this isn’t my fault and isn’t something I have control over has begun to help me to accept things more, and also helps me to keep that little bit of hope for the future."

Period cramps are often treated with over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen, aspirin and paracetamol. But natural remedies for period pain can become part of people's self care for period cramps and bring comfort as natural period pain relief. Everybody and every period is different, so finding what works best for you is important.

This article explores some common natural remedies for periods, including exercise, different foods, essential oils, supplements and herbal remedies for period pain.

What Causes Period Pain?

Menstrual cramps are the effect of contractions in the uterus during your period, resulting in spasms, aches and throbbing of varying degrees in the abdomen (belly), pelvis (hip area), lower back and upper legs.

This pain, also known as ‘dysmenorrhoea’, is caused by the production of prostaglandins – natural chemicals that play a role in promoting inflammation – in the early stages of the menstrual cycle. These chemicals also cause vomiting, headaches, diarrhoea and nausea during periods.

Sometimes called premenstrual syndrome (PMS), menstrual cramps can start a couple of days before your period comes and can continue on into your period. The discomfort can last for 48-72 hours, ranging from light, mild and severe cramps in people who menstruate.

Other factors and underlying conditions can increase the risk of experiencing severe menstrual cramps, like smoking, stress, endometriosis, PCOS and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Period pain typically becomes milder as a person gets older.

Natural Remedies for Period Pain

Yep, you’ve heard it before, but the best natural remedies for period pain are often the simplest and really focusing on our movement, sleep and diet can go a long long way.

Exercise

An easy home remedy for period pain is engaging in light exercise on your period, including gentle stretching, yoga or going for a short walk. When you exercise, your brain releases endorphins, dubbed ‘feel-good’ chemicals, that act as your body’s natural period pain relief and mood booster. Endorphins work by blocking pain signals from your brain, which helps block pain signals to your uterus and thereby alleviate cramping. That said, exercise can aggravate period pain for some people and have no effect for others.

Moderate Activity

High-intensity exercises like running during your period may not be appropriate or comfortable for you and your period pain. The best forms of exercise for your menstrual pain, our WUKA Period Health Experts say, are light walking or other light cardio exercises – exercises that get your heart rate up and help your blood circulation. Wearing WUKA Sports Period Pants can help you feel comfortable whilst staying active to relieve period pain.

Yoga

During lighter menstrual days, low intensity exercises to relieve period pain such as yoga and pilates can help you manage heavy cramping as a complementary therapy. Certain yoga poses like Cat, Cobra and Child's Pose can be good for your heavy bleeding days too. Remember, stretching is best done when your body is warm.

Our period-proof Seamless underwear are perfect for yogis

Diet

Eating a balanced and healthy diet rich in fibre and antioxidants is crucial to maintaining a regular menstrual cycle and can reduce painful period symptoms. Food can also affect your hormones which in turn determines your mood, how long you bleed and how light period flow is.

Some foods you eat during your periods can help to relieve menstrual cramps. Research shows that adding anti-inflammatory action of omega-3 can be used for natural period pain relief. Omega-3s are essential fatty acids – meaning those our bodies need but can’t naturally make them. Foods high in omega-3 fatty acids include oily fish (salmon, mackerel, sardines and anchovies, to name a few) and can be taken as capsules in supplement form throughout the menstrual cycle as well. Vegetarian and vegan sources of omega-3 fatty acids include flaxseeds, chia seeds and brussel sprouts.

Dehydration is a common cause of menstrual cramps, so upping your water intake will help you stay hydrated and reduce period pain.

Sleep

According to the National Sleep Foundation (NSF) in America, many women find it difficult to sleep just before and during their period. This could be due to physical and emotional effects of hormone changes during your menstrual cycle, including menstrual cramps.

However, different sleeping positions may provide natural period pain relief from cramps and help you better sleep on your period. While there is little research on the topic, some healthcare providers suggest sleeping in a foetal position to reduce menstrual cramps. If sleeping in this position helps you, then keep at it. If not, try small adjustments to find what feels most comfortable for you.

Herbal Remedies for Period Pain

As well as lifestyle factors, herbs can be a great option for anyone wanting to try out period pain natural remedies. Herbal medicine is the use of medicinal plants and plant extracts to help prevent and treat diseases. It’s important to note that evidence for the effectiveness of herbal medicines is generally very limited. Although some people find them helpful, in many cases the use of herbal medicine tends to be based on traditional use rather than scientific research.

If you opt to use herbal remedies for period pain, it is advised that you talk with your healthcare provider about the pros and cons in the context of your general health. According to the NHS, if you want to try herbal medicine, look out for a traditional herbal registration (THR) marking on product packaging.

Chamomile

Chamomile is one of the most commonly used herbal remedies for period pain due to its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antispasmodic properties. The compounds hippurate and glycine within chamomile makes chamomile tea, for example, useful to help ease lower abdomen cramps by relaxing tense muscles.

Evening Primrose Oil

Akin to its name, evening primrose oil is the oil extracted from the evening primrose plant, often found in capsule form. It has a long history of being used for natural period pain relief. Rich in gamma-linolenic acid, evening primrose oil works as a natural anti-inflammatory to reduce prostaglandin, the hormone that triggers muscles in your uterus to contract.

Ginger

Ginger is a common choice amongst the herbal remedies for pain relief for people who suffer from menstrual cramps and heavy bleeding due to its anti-inflammatory properties. In fact, research has found that ginger can be as effective as ibuprofen when it comes to relieving menstrual pain. A review of studies around the effectiveness of ginger for alleviating period pain saw that over 600 women who consumed 750-2,000 mg of ginger powder during the first 3-4 days of their period found it appeared to help reduce pain from menstrual cramps.

Crampbark

As the name hints, the herbal form of crampbark is a traditional herbal remedy used for soothing period pain. Usually consumed by boiling dried bark in water as a tea, crampbark contains methyl salicylate, a compound known to have pain-relieving properties. One study published in the Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada found that a herbal formulation containing crampbark improved PMS symptoms including menstrual cramping. Research on crampbark is generally more limited compared to other menstrual remedies.

Fennel

Research published in the Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology has shown that sweet fennel, a choice of natural remedies for periods, is teeming with anti-inflammatory properties and, when consumed regularly, helps to soothe period cramps. Whether in raw fennel seed form or seeds soaked in water to create fennel tea, fennel is an excellent digestive aid, reduces bloating and keeps your energies up too.

Pcycnogenol

Pcycnogenol (pronounced pic-noj-en-all) is a compound that comes from the bark of a French pine tree, and it is used for natural period pain relief. Medically trialled on perimenopausal women and women with endometriosis, Pycnogenol was found to alleviate menstrual pain as a therapeutic alternative. Usually taken by mouth in capsule form, Pycnogenol contains potent natural antioxidant natural chemicals that inhibit prostaglandins, making it an anti-inflammatory remedy.

Cinnamon

Cinnamon, in both powder and oil form, is another natural herbal remedy that can be used to alleviate menstrual cramps. Some studies have shown that cinnamon is a safe and effective treatment for dysmenorrhea, or period pain. Aside from providing natural period pain relief, cinnamon has also been known to provide natural relief from heavy bleeding as well as nausea.

Consult Your Doctor

Taking herbal medicines for period pain may not be suitable for you and your health. It is advised that you talk with your healthcare provider before trying herbal medicine.

If you experience severe menstrual cramps that interfere with daily life or don’t respond to pain relief, this could be an indication of an underlying condition, so please speak with your healthcare provider before trying any natural remedies for period pain.





KEY TAKEAWAYS:

🌼 Menstrual cramps are a common symptom before and during a period. Severe menstrual cramps can be an indication of an underlying and serious health condition.

🌼 Exercise, essential oils, foods, sleeping positions and herbal tea can be used as home remedies for natural period pain relief. More scientific research is needed for the effectiveness of herbal remedies for period pain."

Further information on cancer screening for trans people can be found in PHE’s guide to NHS Screening Programmes for trans people.","addressing, women, inequalities, coverage, trans, lgbt, cancer, screening, phe, healthcare, lb, evidence, cervical","Where evidence is available, it suggests that cancer screening coverage is lower in lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) communities.

Not attending screening ties into wider findings in terms of LGBT people and their reluctance to access healthcare.

For example, a Stonewall report found that 14% of LGBT people, including 37% of trans people, have avoided accessing healthcare services due to fear of being discriminated against.

Furthermore, the National LGBT Survey found that:

at least 16% of respondents who had accessed or tried to access public health services have had a negative experience based on their sexual orientation

38% have had a negative experience related to their trans status

The LGBT survey pointed out that more research was needed to determine the effect these factors were having on health.

Cervical screening

Lesbian and bisexual (LB) women are less likely to have been for cervical screening. Figures show that 15% of LB women over 25 have never had a cervical screening test compared to 7% of women over 25 in general.

This lower uptake is partly due to the misconception that women who only have sex with women do not require cervical screening tests.

Told ‘not at risk’

One LB women’s health check found that 20% of LB women who had not attended a cervical screening did not think they were at risk of cervical cancer.

Possible reasons for this are highlighted by an LGBT Foundation study in the North West which found that 37% of LB women were told at one point that they did not need a test because of their sexual orientation, in some instances by healthcare professionals.

The study found 14% had been actively refused or discouraged from having a cervical screening by a healthcare professional as a result of their sexual orientation.

One respondent quoted in the North West study said:

Nurses and doctors have always said I don’t need screening, that lesbians cannot get cervical cancer.

Half of LB women who hadn’t had a cervical screen test said they were ‘scared’ to have the test.

One factor which could be contributing to coverage being lower may be that people who don’t have penetrative sex may find the procedure more uncomfortable and invasive. To reduce this discomfort, LB people may need a smaller speculum, however they may be reluctant to discuss this. In 2017, 53% of LB women did not disclose their sexual orientation to healthcare staff.

Trans men who still have a cervix should consider screening. There is limited evidence on coverage among trans men. However, a small scale US study found half of trans men had not had a test in the previous 3 years.

Breast screening

The evidence is more limited in terms of breast screening coverage among LB women.

A Stonewall survey found that 80% of lesbians over the age of 50 have had a breast screening test, which is roughly the same to women in general. However, among women over 40, 80% of heterosexual women would go to the doctor within a week of finding a lump, compared to 75% of lesbians and 68% of bisexual women.

There is a perception that healthcare professionals do not have adequate knowledge surrounding screening and LB women.

37% of lesbians, compared to 69% of heterosexual women, thought that appropriate attitudes of healthcare professionals contributed to a good experience of breast screening.

Trans men and women often should consider breast cancer screening, but there is no evidence on coverage of breast screening among trans people.

Bowel cancer screening

There is no evidence on LGBT people’s uptake of bowel cancer screening.

More evidence needed

As you can see, evidence on cancer screening coverage in LGBT communities varies and this is something that urgently needs to be addressed.

The 2018 National LGBT Action Plan highlighted the need to put LGBT people’s needs ‘at the heart of the National Health Service’, however not knowing enough about what these needs are creates a barrier to progress.

Implementing sexual orientation and trans status monitoring across all NHS services would ensure there is up-to-date and comprehensive evidence on LGBT communities’ experiences of healthcare, including cancer screening coverage. More information about monitoring is available online via the LGBT Foundation.

Advice for local screening services

Simple steps such as having LGBT posters or leaflets in waiting rooms and having staff wear rainbow lanyards or badges can go a long way in making LGBT people feel more welcomed and included at screening services. Staff shouldn't make assumptions about whether a person is LGBT or not if they haven't said.

More blog posts to come

This post is the first in a series about cancer screening in LGBT communities. Next up, we'll be looking at cancer screening in trans communities and how screening services can take steps to be more LGBT inclusive. Further information on cancer screening for trans people can be found in PHE’s guide to NHS Screening Programmes for trans people.

In May 2018, PHE Screening’s inequalities strategy was launched to highlight our commitment to reduce inequalities in access to screening services and address barriers that prevent people and communities from engaging with or participating in screening.

I really needed something to help me to get back on track. Sessions with Kate were the perfect tonic. Over Christmas I took a break from treatment and gained techniques from Kate to help build up resilience and self care basket ready for starting a 3rd cycle in February.I started treatment in early February and it went very smoothly. We had a fresh day 5 embryo transfer on 19th February. This was also the due date for the baby we lost last year and the feelings surrounding this date were big and mixed but Kate helped me through it.We had several sessions during the 2 week wait and learnt techniques to try and keep as rational and calm as possible and this was so so so beneficial. On our final session I was able to share the lovely news that it had been successful and we talked about the emotions that came with pregnancy after loss.Being a nurse myself I really appreciated her clinical advice on top of her support and practical techniques she gave to help me through this cycle. The support from my clinic was amazing but they were busy. To be able to sit with a knowledgeable, kind and compassionate healthcare professional for an hour at a time during treatment really helped to keep my stress levels low and to be in the best shape for getting through one of the most challenging few weeks I have ever been through with hope and sanity still intact. My favourite bit of advice was to make a plan for test day to have the time with my husband to talk and reflect on the outcome. We went out for a meal together and just talked and took in the news.I’m now 2nd trimester pregnant with a healthy little baby boy on the way and I still have to pinch myself at times to believe that it worked. It was a dark period of hopelessness following my 2nd cycle and honestly feel that with each session everything got lighter and lighter.

What Our Patients Say

Sarah I have learnt more about food and feel more alert and energetic. I have lost weight, have a flatter tummy and feel much healthier. Lots of people are telling me how well I look! Michelle I have been aware of Marilyn Glenville’s work for 10 years now and indeed have been helped by her on several occasions. I find her a very sane, sensible and interesting practitioner and I trust in her judgement and am interested in her work. I suppose the issue that interests us all is how to age well and healthily and that prevention is far better than cure. Hillary I first made contact with the Glenville clinic after experiencing distressing and debilitating digestive problems for more than 30 years and after trying every diet, remedy and alternative therapy I came across. So I approached my initial appointment with Miki with a little scepticism but was quickly reassured by her obvious knowledge and expertise, and particularly encouraged to hear that she recognised my symptoms and believed that they could be overcome. Miki’s initial hypothesis was backed up by a scientific test and after so many years of struggle, it was such a relief to finally have a firm diagnosis. Miki has gently encouraged me through a systematic programme of recovery involving dietary changes and supplements and approached my treatment holistically; taking all aspects of my life into account. My symptoms are now so minimal and I can sincerely say that the programme has, for me, been life-changing. I can’t thank Miki enough for all her expertise, care and support. Linda I just want to say thank you for the information. As many times I have asked my doctor for info and she has just seemed to want to give me a pill or take something out! I wish I had found this web-site before I had a total hysterectomy 5 years ago. I am just glad I found it now. I stopped HRT 3 monthsa go. After 7 years of it. Thanks again so very much. Marie I have been looking after my health with help from Dr. Glenville for many years. However, I would point out that there appears to be a dearth of information for the over 60′s. I would like to continue learning with Dr. Glenville as I have discovered that there is indeed life after the menopause. Janet Many thanks for all your help and support during our IVF treatment. Our son just perfect. Your nutritional advice made such a different not just in terms of preparing us for IVF but also for our health generally. We are now lifelong converts to your health eating approach. Barbara The zoom session was very helpful to me and I received some very good nutrional advice and advice on supplements and what not to eat. Margaret It is about a year since I first came to the clinic, and in October we gave birth to a beautiful, healthy baby boy. I watched my diet and took the supplements and conceived naturally. At 40 years of age, I can’t thank you enough for my precious little boy. I now hope to try again this year and hopefully may conceive again. I can’t thank you enough for all you’ve done. The joy in my life now is incredible and it was the most wonderful Christmas ever, with our new baby son. Anonymous I want to say a big THANK YOU to Dr Glenville. My husband has lost 5 kilo weight and several dress sizes. His old pants do not fit anymore. His shirts from 8 year ago have started to fit again. He feels much better also. His waist line has shrunk. He cannot believe these changes. This is amazing. All he is doing is taking the supplements, eating right food and exercise. He had weight issues for over 15 years, he was unable to lose and his motivation had gone down. Thanks for making this happen. THANK YOU once again. Sue I did find the session with Sharon extremely helpful. Initially, I was concerned that she did not seem to be addressing my Parkinsons issue, but after further discussion with her she advised me to look at the situation with regards to a healthy body and consequently, a side-effect of this would be to be in the best shape possible and the knock-on effect would be to help the Parkinson’s so all in all I was happy that everything was addressed very thoroughly. Her advice on what vitamins et cetera I could take with my current medication was very sound and an extreme help to me. I thought her manner came over as very professional but also sympathetic and interested and I’m looking forward to my next session with her. Josephine If it hadn’t been for my friend recommending me to Marilyn then this may never have happened to us – I am so grateful. If it is possible please pass this on to Marilyn with our thanks for our miracle baby. Forever grateful Sean and Susan We are happy and excited to share with you our little son, our pride and joy. It was a long journey with a few bumps on the road, but at the end, this little miracle washes away all the bad memories. We want to thank you for guiding us through this past year and a half. Your professional help, your encouragement, kindness and warmth will never be forgotten. We wish you many more successful family creations like ours Victoria I am sending heartfelt thanks to you for transforming my health over the last year. Having had 15 years of continual illness, I now find myself able to live life in a way I thought would never be possible again. Thanks to you careful analysis and treatment, I now feel better than I have done in a couple of decades. I can’t tell you how grateful I am. I’m making sure that everyone hears about you, so that my family and friends can benefit too. With kindest wishes (and love, of course) Nicola My appointment with Helen was great. I always enjoy talking to Helen and have been seeing her on and off for many years and through various life changes and ups and downs with my health. I find her empathetic, well-informed about my health history and find her manner caring, professional and supportive. I have recommended Helen to friends over the years as I think so highly of her. Susan Just sending you this note of thanks. You devised an eating plan of vitamins and minerals that we needed. Since then we had ICSI treatment and had a little girl. After her birth, I followed your programme again because I wanted another baby. This time we conceived naturally. So thank you very much for all your help. We would not be a family without your help. I am positive that with your help ICSI worked for us the first time, so thank you for that too. Anonymous … a wonderful breath of fresh air in the confusing world of the menopause and HRT. I have acted upon, and benefited immensely from your advice – thank you for that. Joan Over the past year l have received consultations with Sally, and I have:

– learnt a lot more about nutrition

– managed to lose 18 lbs

– changed my diet and exercise every day up to 7km on my training bike. I have now managed to come off blood pressure tablets which is wonderful… For a 72-year-old this is all good news. Sally has been instrumental in my progress. I will continue to have 6 monthly consultations when l next have my routine blood test. Francesca The pregnancy continued to go well and I’m expecting our daughter on Christmas day. Not sure what you did, but something worked and it’s because of all your help that pregnancy number 5 (had 4 miscarriages and had been under St Mary’s) is soon to be baby no. 1. We are more grateful than you could ever know…. FR Alison I have had a very good consultation with Sharon Pitt who has been very good.She went through my test results very clearly and in great detail. She has answered all my questions, had sensible suggestions for follow up and sent me the full set of consultation notes the same day. Thank you! Rachel She was conceived naturally after two failed IVF cycles, thank you so much for your help …all is going well, she is wonderful and we couldn’t be happier. I originally came to see you with my husband for advice on how to get my periods back to being regular. I have since found that I am pregnant, which is fantastic. Anonymous Again, I am so gratefully thankful for individuals like yourself and others that actually take out the time to allow us to ask you questions and give us your patience and answer the questions… Thank You for Listening. Anonymous I think very highly of Dr Glenville’s approach. I think Marilyn is a unique and great bridge between ‘sensible mainstream medicine’ and ‘nutritionists’. There are so many factors that affect our health and sometimes it is mind boggling trying to figure out what is the best treatment etc. It is reassuring to know that Dr Glenville advises us on the issues that affect women in a simplified, interesting and informative way. Elizabeth So quite frankly I thank God for Marilyn and her team and the work they are doing and I pray you will continue this good work!!! Francesca You will be very pleased to hear that I am doing as Dr Marilyn says, and eating every 3 hours (no pork pies either!), I’m taking my supplements, and I’m walking to work rather than catching the tube (when it is not raining!). I feel a lot better for it, and seem to have more enthusiasm for work. It’s only been a week, but I just don’t feel as tired and ‘heavy’ somehow. Maria The consultations with Helen Ford are hugely informative. Her breadth of knowledge in respect of nutrition and supplements is vast. I suffered with psoriasis for many years and, thanks to Helen, I no longer have it. I can highly recommend Helen Ford and the wonderful team at Glenville Nutrition. Thank you! Mary I would just like to let you know that I have been following the ‘lose your belly’ plan for two weeks now with great success. Not only have I lost weight and my flattened my belly, but I notice a big difference in my skin and hair. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Irene I am the lady with high FSH (50+, age 41) who had a baby following your diet, after being told I had a less than 1 per cent chance of conceiving. My husband and I want to pass on our heartfelt thanks to you for helping to bring our baby son into the world. We really cannot thank you enough for the tremendous difference you have made to our lives in helping this ‘high FSH’ lady have a baby, so long hoped for. Anissa My consultation with Helen was excellent. She took the time to go through all my test results and was very thorough.

I absolutely loved my session with Dr Garside. He is warm, professional and I felt very comfortable in his presence. Mostly importantly, the hypnosis session with him worked! I noticed results with a few weeks. Couldn’t recommend him more. Wayne Kwong Trustindex verifies that the original source of the review is Google. I was recommended by my dentist to consider hypnotherapy for my problematic teeth grinding, which result in frequent teeth chipping. Not having had this type of therapy before, I did some research online. Jonathan’s credentials looked excellent and interesting too, being a qualified pilot as well as a hypnotherapist! His clinic on Regent’s Street is very convenient too. In my first session, I was immediately put at ease with Jonathan’s calm and friendly demeanour. His soothing voice definitely helped. After just one session, I could feel the benefit already. I felt calmer, less anxious and more sure about myself. A dental follow up after the third session confirmed that there was no further teeth chipping or evidence of teeth grinding. Even at the latest check up one year on, my teeth remained healthy! The effect of just a few sessions seems to be long lasting. I would highly recommend Jonathan should anyone need a professional, friendly and excellent hypnotherapist in Central London. Kate Knight Trustindex verifies that the original source of the review is Google. Woohoo, Jonathan is truly wonderful. It’s been over 4 months since I started my hypnosis journey, and every day since has been vastly improved. So excited with all the new possibilities and adventures to be had using this highly effective tool, your subconscious! It’s totally enlightened the way that I conduct my life, thought process, and general attitude and outlook, in a positive, calm, and happy way. I truly believe this process has brought me back to who I am meant to be- happy, carefree, positive, considerate, and generally enjoying life. Dealing with all life’s challenges one day at a time! All I can say… Jonathan thank you so very much… life is now bursting with sunshine again, all thanks to your amazing gift in the art of hypnosis! You’re truly a star 💫 James Whitehouse Trustindex verifies that the original source of the review is Google. Jonathan is one of the most amazing people I've ever met. He is bursting with warmth and positivity - I honestly think it might be impossible to be negative in his presence. He is immensely kind and understanding and put me instantly at ease, which helped greatly in itself with some of the issues I went into hypnosis to work on. He is immensely knowledgeable in his field, and tailored his approach to my individual needs. My insomnia and social anxiety, both of which had impacted my life and career in various ways over the years, were hugely reduced after three sessions and he also prepared a recording for me, which has diminished their effects even further over time. I now no longer consider either of these things a problem in my life, which I feel is incredible in just a few months. I have subsequently taken Jonathan's Self-Hypnosis course, which was not only fascinating, but I'm sure will transform my life in hugely positive ways in the long-term - very early days on my exciting new journey so far...!

I was very cynical about this whole process at first (although I really hoped it would help!) but it has definitely made a big improvement in my sleep. I had 4 sessions with Jonathan and he is a lovely guy who really puts your mind at ease. It's also a really relaxing way to spend an hour! I wish I had done this 20 years ago. Jonathan also offers a free consultation which is a great way to find out if it might help you. Tiare Y Trustindex verifies that the original source of the review is Google. I had the incredible privilege of attending Jonathan Garside's Self Hypnosis hypnotherapy sessions recently, and I couldn't be happier from the experience. Right from the moment I stepped into Jonathan's clinic, I felt an immediate connection. As a first-timer, I was uncertain about what to expect, but Jonathan's calming presence quickly put me at ease. The work we did together has been immensely valuable, and I genuinely believe it has played a significant role in my professional and personal growth. Jonathan's attention to detail, cultural sensitivity, and the warmth he exudes are truly commendable. The Deep Relaxation technique alone was worth its weight in gold. It has opened up a world of possibilities for me, and I am absolutely thrilled by the endless potential that lies ahead. I wholeheartedly recomend Jonathan to everyone. It's had a profound impact on my personal development and well-being. Thank you, Jonathan, for this life-changing experience! Matt Bowe Trustindex verifies that the original source of the review is Google. It worked! I was initially dubious about hypnosis however Jonathan came highly recommended by two friends that were previously smokers. After the first session my mindset to smoking had completely changed. Despite intentionally keeping a packet of cigarettes in a drawer at home to see if I'd give into temptation, I haven't even considered smoking once. I'd thoroughly recommend the personal tape recording - I found it became an enjoyable form of meditation in everyday life to remain calm, positive and confident. Likhita Udyawar Trustindex verifies that the original source of the review is Google. I had the privilege of working with Jonathan for several sessions, and I can confidently say that the experience has been nothing short of transformative. From the very first session, I was impressed by his expertise, and genuine care for my well-being. The sessions were conducted in a comfortable and welcoming environment, allowing me to relax and fully engage in the process. Jonathan took the time to truly understand my goals and challenges, tailoring each session to address my specific needs. My sessions with him allowed me to break through mental barriers, and develop a more positive mindset. I am amazed at the insights I gained and the positive changes I have been experiencing in my daily life. In all, a truly transformative experience with an exceptional hypnotherapist. I highly recommend Jonathan to anyone seeking personal growth, self-discovery, or a way to overcome challenges. Adrian Whelton Trustindex verifies that the original source of the review is Google. After over 10 years of insomnia, I am finally sleeping 6+ hours a night, having gone from 3-4 if I was lucky! For me it was not an overnight fix and in fact after my final session with Jonathan there was little improvement. I had high expectations after the last session and when there wasn’t an immediate improvement I worried the hypnotherapy had not worked. However, a few weeks later my sleep started improving and I am now sleeping the best I have in years. I had tried everything, sleep therapists, books, pills, lotions, apps, white noise etc.etc. but nothing worked. I highly advise Jonathan’s hypnotherapy. Its not an overnight fix but if you trust the process it really does work! For me, daily sunlight, exercise and sleep hygiene are still important factors for good sleep, but without Jonathon’s hypnotherapy I would not be sleeping as well as I do now. Thank you! Marco Colombo Trustindex verifies that the original source of the review is Google. I had the privilege and pleasure of attending the Self Hypnosis course with Jonathan recently and I am very happy with what I learned. Deep hypnosis in itself resonates very well with me and it's much more effective than any CBT or Meditation I had so far. That's why I decided to attend this course: to understand amd be able to unlock its true potential by myself. The concepts that I learnt are powerful, healing and truly transformational: I am genuinely looking forward to seeing how deep I will get and how much I will improve my life (and consequently the one of the people around me). Jonathan has been extremely professional, welcoming, reassuring and clear in every single session we had. I felt safe, taken care of and excited about all I learnt throughout the whole course. But it goes beyond that: Jonathan has dedicated (and still does) most of his life to Hypnosis and he truly cares for it, and that's why he encourages people to stay in touch after the course to monitor ""as a Team"" how things evolve going forward. This is not only professional, but truly reassuring! The Deep Relaxation technique alone was worth the whole course but sky's the limit now, and I am thrilled by the endless possibilities in front of me. I would recommend this course to everyone, to be fair, and I hope Hypnosis will have more and more traction going forward. Thank you Jonathan!"

I have found Helen’s nutritional recommendations to be invaluable and will apply what I’ve learnt for the rest of my life. Working with her has made a HUGE difference. I have more energy, haven’t been ill, understand my body a whole lot better and feel more optimistic about my health generally. Helen’s knowledge is extensive, her test recommendations were spot on. The supplements and dietary alterations she suggested have made a very real difference to my day-to-day life. Her recommendations are also practical, realistic and I found them easy to follow. Since working with her my friends have commended on how well I’ve been looking! Helen’s approach is steady and realistic and her knowledge extensive. What is also great is that this knowledge can be applied going forward for the rest of one’s life. Helen is very pleasant to work with - I felt very safe in her hands. I have no hesitation in recommending her and the London Clinic of Nutrition who I found to be courteous and supportive. It has been money very well spent!

She has been an absolute delight to work with and can happily say that I am now feeling so much better, her expert guidance has made this possible. Thank you.

Maria Ignatova 20 December, 2023 I was hit with MCAS and gut health issues in the beginning of 2023. Despite all the help from the NHS, consultations with a gastroenterologist, immunologist and another MCAS specialist, measures suggested by them were not helping me. I started working with Paul in August 2023. Thanks to the healing steps recommended by him I went from being bedridden in July to being able to exercise in September (I was unable to exercise for 6 months prior to that). Apart from MCAS Paul helped me to find a root cause and a solution for my SIBO, fungal overgrowth and gut dysbiosis, as well as untangle a complicated puzzle of my tricky genetic profile, uncover past trauma and enable me to heal my nervous system. My healing journey took several months and I’m still tackling the last bits, but I’m immensely grateful to all the support from Paul and confident my complete recovery is around the corner. ☀️ I want to extend my gratitude to other members of the clinic. Everyone I interacted with were always attentive, empathetic and incredibly helpful. 🤗 Next time I have a tricky health issue, I’ll seek functional medicine help by default over a traditional healthcare approach.

Kira Edwards 29 August, 2023 I worked with Helen at LCON to address Thyroid issues (auto immune in nature), chronic stomach issues (constipation and bloating), severe period issues which impacted my daily routine, headaches and low energy. My health was at rock bottom where my mental health was now being impacted, when I decided I had nothing to lose by paying and getting help privately, although I was extremely worried about doing so with many people telling me I was wasting my money! It was the best thing I have done, and I am only gutted I did not take the plunge and seek the help I needed sooner. Helen has been brilliant and the recommendations and plans she gave me has seen (self-rating) approximately 85% of my symptoms cleared up / in a place where I can now manage them successfully knowing my triggers (been on the plans since April 2023). I am now back in the gym which is what I enjoy, I am tolerating a LOT more food than ever before, my periods are still a work in progress but a lot more manageable where I am no longer needing to take anti-inflammatory medication and overall feel I have mental clarity and calmness. I had two comprehensive tests done which allowed the support I needed to be tailored to me, so you need to ensure you budget for tests on top of consultation costs, plus monthly allowance to cover your supplements which I had luckily prepared for. My only feedback to LCON would be to advise clients to book a support call in a couple of weeks after starting any supplements, as I had lots of questions and actually reacted to a supplement (luckily the reception put me in touch with Helen straight away who advised to stop the supplement until our support call) - but the support calls were often weeks away when booking, so preparing a support call would be good to reassure clients if they had any queries or concerns early on in the plan. Biggest advice to anyone who is thinking about getting help, do it ,don't wait any longer to feel better - but be ready to commit as you will not see the results if you are not ready to give 100%! Huge thank you to Helen who I can not thank enough for everything you have done, and the clinic staff for all your help and support. Kira"

The Huel Guide to Cheat MealsOn paper, cheat days and cheat meals sound great.
But what, exactly, are cheat days and cheat meals?
Cheat days are whole days where you'd essentially eat anything and everything you'd normally not be 'allowed' to eat under a strict diet plan – pizza for breakfast?
How often you choose to have cheat days depends on how you are disbursing your calories throughout the week.","strict, goals, cheat, day, diet, consume, good, eat, huel, days, guide, meals, plan, youre","Are 'Cheat Days' Good For you? The Huel Guide to Cheat Meals

On paper, cheat days and cheat meals sound great. Simply stick to a strict diet for a couple of days then eat whatever you want? Not so fast. We're here to set the record straight.

There's a very good chance you've seen Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson's epic cheat meals on social media, followed by very strict dieting and a ton of exercise [1].

But what, exactly, are cheat days and cheat meals? Cheat days are whole days where you'd essentially eat anything and everything you'd normally not be 'allowed' to eat under a strict diet plan – pizza for breakfast? Burgers for dinner? Why not!

Cheat meals follow a similar concept but restrict you to just one meal outside of your prescribed daily diet. You could have pizza for breakfast, for example, but you'd need to eat like a regular human being the rest of the day.

In theory, it sounds like a great idea. But is this something that we should all be doing and is it realistic?

What’s the problem with cheat meals?

First, let’s talk about the name. 'Cheat meal' or 'cheat day' are not the best names because you’re not cheating on anything – the phrasing makes it seem like you’re doing something bad or wrong. There’s nothing wrong with consuming these foods or having a bit more than usual on occasion. One relaxed day, every once in a while, will not hinder your goals and for a majority of people who have cheat days, they are also scheduled ahead of time too [1-6].

Another dietary pattern you may hear that has a similar concept to a cheat day is alternate-day fasting or '5-2' diet. This is a dietary pattern where you follow a strict plan including a sharp decrease in calorie intake followed by days where you consume a greater amount of calories [2-4].

Why do people have cheat days?

You might say you’re having a cheat day for a variety of reasons. It may be that you’re on a rigid plan to gain muscle or lose weight. As a result, you’re looking for one day during the week where you can take the stress off.

Online articles frequently refer to a paper from 2015 that looks at strict dietary patterns to meet goals [1,5-7]. The paper ultimately concludes that cheat days can be helpful in scenarios where you are following a strict plan, especially due to the fact that they are set ahead of time [5].

A 'day off' from your diet during the week might keep you from feeling like a strict diet plan is totally unmanageable, but is this sustainable?

Another paper from 2016 looked at differences in two weight-loss strategies between two groups of participants [4]. One group followed an extreme version of alternate-day fasting where participants alternated between days where they consumed zero calories and days where they consumed as much as they wanted.

The other group of participants followed standard weight-loss recommendations with a calorie reduction of 400kcal per day. The researchers found that the alternate-day fasting group consumed significantly fewer calories per day on average (by over 300kcal) when compared to the standard weight loss group. However, the alternate-day fasting group only lost slightly more weight than the standard weight loss group, likely indicating they lost more muscle.

How to count calories

How often should you have cheat meals?

In the quest for nutrition or health-related goals, we may impose a bunch of restrictions on ourselves to get there quickly. These drastic restrictions can be hard to follow long term. This is the main reason why cheat days are added into a routine (5). It gives you a bit of room to breathe following a very strict period of time with many “dos and don’ts.”

Don’t get us wrong, a day where you can eat whatever you wish sounds really inviting. Problems might arise, however, when you go back to a very restrictive intake...

Over time, you may begin to eat more on your cheat days because you know you are going back into a period of restriction - especially if this is not a supervised plan with a Registered Dietitian or other health professional.

You may begin to wonder why you’re not achieving your goals or why it’s taking longer than expected.

You may not feel so great physically and psychologically following a cheat day or meal - whether that’s because you’ve consumed foods or amounts of food you don’t normally consume or maybe you start to feel a bit down overall due to the nature of a cheat day. You may start to become fixated on the cycle.

Cheat days work for some people, especially as a short-term solution to nutrition and health goals. In some cases, they may work in the longer term too. How often you choose to have cheat days depends on how you are disbursing your calories throughout the week. Once you have an idea of how many calories you wish to consume each day, you can then work out how many meals you wish to have.

Is there a better way? How to cheat healthy

First, you have to figure out how you want to eat. How often will you want a break from your diet? Is this something you can do long-term?

When there is success in the long-term with this, it likely takes a lot of planning, money, time, access, and effort to follow (insert The Rock) [1-6]. We don’t suggest it as cheat days will likely be difficult to maintain without access to resources, accountability, and the consistent time to plan it all out each week.

What are the alternatives to a cheat day?

Our approach differs from The Rock when it comes to nutrition. More specifically with regard to building muscle, our approach takes away the cheat day and gives you back time too.

Nutrition for building muscle

Generally speaking, no matter your nutrition/health-related goals, the first thing you should do is assess your intake as it is now and what you’re trying to achieve. How often do you like to eat, what kinds of things do you enjoy, what might you want to add a bit more of, what might you want to limit?

After you’ve figured out your baseline, then start to think about your goals and what small changes you can make to get there.

Know that if you have a day every once in a while where you consume more calories than usual or expected or have foods you don’t typically consume, even if it’s not planned, it won’t destroy your goals or your progress [4]. This isn’t a cheat day, this is life.

We like to look at it this way - rather than focusing on what you have to take out of your intake or what you are doing wrong, focus on what you should consume more of or what you should do more of throughout the day.

Maybe you want to add some additional fruits and vegetables, Huel, or lean protein to your intake - and maybe through that, you start to consume less fried food or less red meat because you’ve filled your plate with better options. Don’t make the initial goal restrictive - try to start it with what you’re going to add.

Changing your mindset around food/nutrition can bring about a fun and exciting experience and is one you are more likely to sustain.

If you're starting to worry that there's no such thing as a healthy cheat meal, worry not – look no further than our naughty-but-nutritious Huel vegan Mac & Cheeze.

The Budwig Diet: Flax Oil-Cottage Cheese Diet for the UK

The Budwig diet was created in Germany and the books were originally written in German. The translations and most English websites are written for the North American market which can make them confusing in the UK, so this site has been written specifically to help people get the best from following the Budwig diet.

Correctly followed and as close as possible to Johanna Budwig’s original, it tastes good and has a great reputation for improving health.

A complete UK guide to this complementary alternative treatment

The Budwig diet was created by a leading German scientist, Dr Johanna Budwig. It is often referred to as the Budwig Protocol as it is a holistic treatment that includes lifestyle changes. It was originally written in German and although translated into “English”, it was done mainly for North America so we have created this site to make it easier to get started on the protocol and follow the diet in the UK.

The Budwig protocol was developed by Dr Johanna Budwig in Germany in 1940/50’s. It is used both by people wanting to avoid drugs and as

support whilst undergoing other treatments. It has continued to be a well respected complementary treatment in Germany. It is increasingly throughout the rest of the world.

Popular lifestyle and diet protocol

This popular protocol is designed to treat many conditions and illnesses naturally with diet and lifestyle. These include autoimmune diseases, degenerative, metabolic and inflammatory conditions from digestive issues to cancer, skin conditions to arthritis, diabetes to heart disease . There is a worldwide community of people following the diet. The necessary components of the diet are inexpensive and easily available in shops or can be made at home.

Pleasant tasting and easy to follow

The Budwig diet which includes a blend of cottage cheese and linseed (flaxseed) oil may sound a little strange but don’t worry, as you get used to preparing the meals you will adapt them to your own palate and find the diet is delicious. The basic Budwig linseed cream with ground linseed, fruit, honey nuts and berries tastes so good if you can serve it to dinner party guests and they will love it too.

A typical day on the Budwig Diet

For detailed instructions to follow the diet see the page “the full diet” and check out all the recipes too.

Morning:

Glass of sauerkraut juice

Green or herbal tea

Budwig “Muesli”: it’s rather like a more delicious version of Eton Mess desert; a cream of cold-pressed linseed oil and quark cottage cheese (or Greek-style yoghurt), ground linseed, fruit, honey, sweet spices, nuts and berries. See recipe.

Raw veggies, cheese and bread (optional)

Glass of freshly pressed juice

Midday

Glass champagne & ground linseed

Raw salad with cold-pressed linseed oil dressing

Optional meat-free course of vegetables, potatoes and rice or similar.

Budwig cream in similar dessert to the Budwig muesli eaten for breakfast

Cup of green tea

Mid Afternoon

A glass of red wine, champagne or freshly squeezed juice with honey (optional) and ground linseed.

Evening meal

Before bed

A glass of red wine

In addition

Throughout the day glasses of fresh juices, with some freshly ground linseed added to each glass, green tea or even the occasional cup of black tea (but without milk and sugar).

Take gentle exercise out doors in sunlight, sleep well, practice relaxation and meditation. There is a bit more, including enemas but this is a good start, See the Budwig Yahoo group and international forum for the diet,

Scientific

The Budwig Protocol has it its heart a diet with its roots in a scientific phenomenon known as the “Warburg Effect” discovered by 1931 Nobel Prize winner, medical doctor and biochemist, Otto Heinrich Warburg. Through his work on respiration he discovered that, in the absence of oxygen, cancer cells would metabolise sugar which enabled them to multiply. In the same era, Dr Johanna Budwig, another eminent German biochemist, found that highly unsaturated cold-pressed linseed oil would carry oxygen into the cells to fight cancer. Increasingly modern scientific research supports the benefits to health of the diet. Read about recent discoveries and science behind the Budwig Diet.

Holistic:

Dr Johanna Budwig developed this into the natural, holistic, diet-based Budwig Protocol also called the Budwig Diet it was scientifically way ahead of its time.

Modern Health Discoveries:

The protocol incorporates what we think of today as leading edge health/diet discoveries; the Budwig protocol addresses: sunshine and vitamin D; gut health and its flora of “good” bacteria; acid-alkali balance; “superfoods” including green tea and improved levels of all nutrients; hormone balancing phyto-nutrients; ketogenic diet; exercise and sleep; the importance of the spiritual and emotional side of healing. The Budwig protocol can be of benefit in many areas of health from the digestion to fertility as well as being used to treat many serious conditions including arthritis, cancer, diabetes and heart disease.

Simple diet with flax oil cottage cheese

The cornerstone of the Budwig diet is Budwig Muesli, the recipe blends linseed (also known as faxseed) oil with quark cottage cheese eaten at breakfast and lunch. The rest of the diet is vegetarian and packed with natural nutrients.

The Budwig Diet, known in North America as FO/CC diet, is one of the most widely-followed alternative remedy for cancer and diabetes. The cornerstone of the diet is cold-pressed linseed (flaxseed) oil, rich in omega-3, blended with fat-free cottage cheese to make it more soluble. This gets the oxygen-carrying omega-3 into the cells where it is needed. Flax Farm has created this website to help people in the UK follow the diet the way Dr Johanna Budwig intended.

Positively False – Exploring the Myths around HIV and AIDS

16th Anniversary Edition – A Book by Joan Shenton

In the 30 years since ‘HIV’ was announced as the “probable cause” of AIDS we are no closer to a vaccine or cure. Scientists and clinicians who question the widely held belief that ‘HIV’ is the cause of AIDS hold fast to their position that multiple factors can be attributed to the illnesses defined as AIDS which continue to afflict specific communities and risk groups, and that billions of dollars and millions of lives have been wasted over a retrovirus that is either harmless or may not even exist. The paperback and Kindle editions are available through Amazon.

We offer the best care

Through our established partnerships with alcohol and drug detox centers, residential rehabilitation facilities, outpatient programmes, counsellors, support groups, and more, we ensure tailored care referrals for each client based on their unique needs. We firmly believe in personalised care and do not believe there is a one-size-fits-all programme for everyone.

We understand the funding challenge for those facing financial constraints. If we cannot help find a way to pay for such care, we do have access to free programmes offered by the NHS. We help our clients navigate the system in order to take advantage of those free programmes. And while this is certainly something clients could do on their own, it’s not easy to do. We take the hassle out of it by helping clients every step of the way.

You don’t have to continue living with addiction, whether it’s your own struggle or that of a loved one. Reach out to us at Middlegate, and let us start guiding you towards recovery. With the right help and support, overcoming addiction is possible."

Breast implant illness (BII) is an unofficial term used by a small number of women who; after having breast implant surgery, self identified symptoms such as tiredness and fatigue, pain in the chest and body, loss of hair, headaches, low mood, confusion, unexplained rashes, sudden body odour and more. The symptoms reported are unique to each woman experiencing them and there appears to be no clear pattern in regards to when the symptoms first appear: Some women report to have struggled with issues from immediately after surgery whilst others claim to have developed symptoms many years later.

The condition also seems to affect women with any type or shape of breast implant: There have been reports of sufferers having both saline and silicone gel filled implants that are either textured or smooth on the surface and either round or teardrop in shape.

Some of the women who experience breast implant illness also get diagnosed with autoimmune and connective tissue disorders, therefore it has been suggested that there may be links between the two conditions. However there is not sufficient evidence to confirm this as many sufferers who present with symptoms of breast implant illness do not also get this second diagnosis.

Although this illness is not officially recognised within the medical world, as a responsible practitioner I feel it is important to not only inform my individual patients of its existence but also to raise awareness of the condition across the web: So that all patients who are thinking of having breast implants, go into surgery being fully informed of any possible risks that are associated with the procedure.

But is the condition real?

Breast implant illness has gained more attention during the past 12 months and recent reports conclude that plastic surgeons, researchers, and other professional organisations are closely monitoring the situation surrounding whether Breast Implant illness does in fact exist. The FDA released a statement saying that they are “taking steps to better characterize [BII] and its risk factors, and are considering ways to help to ensure women have all of the information they need to make informed decisions about whether to obtain breast implants or to remove existing breast implants in an effort to reverse systemic symptoms”.

What is the cause of breast implant illness?

There have been some proposals put forward that breast implant illness may be due to the woman’s body’s inflammatory reaction to the implant, which it sees as a foreign object. Other suggestions include it is the body reacting to specific materials within the implants, whilst others have tried to link it to the surgical technique of inserting the implant. However due to the fact that the condition is currently not recognised as a medical illness and there is currently little scientific evidence to support any connection between implants and the symptoms reported, it is quite difficult to pinpoint what the underlying cause may be.

Is there a connection with lifestyle and breast implant illness?

There have been questions asking whether a person’s lifestyle could be a contributing factor towards the symptoms associated with BII. Again, due to the struggle in regards to finding a definite cause to the symptoms, it makes it just as difficult to determine whether a person’s lifestyle or diet could be contributing towards their symptoms. Feedback off suffers, who have changed their routine, diet and other lifestyle factors but not seen any improvements in their symptoms, suggests that the two are not connected.

Diagnosis

There currently is no formal way of diagnosing breast implant illness. A lot of women who end up claiming to suffer with BII have gone through multiple other avenues and exhaustive testing first in an attempt to make sense of their symptoms. It is definitely advisable that the patient seeks help to rule out other causes of the symptoms before coming to the conclusion that it is their implants that are the problem. Tests such as those looking to diagnose arthritis or Lyme disease should be considered as well as keeping a diary or close monitor of the symptoms to see if there is even the slightest of improvement when treatment for other conditions are being received.

Ok I think I have breast implant illness – now what?

Well the condition is not clearly understood – therefore there have been a few different ways that people have attempted to treat it.

In a lot of cases, but not all, the symptoms can be eliminated through having the implants removed as well as the surrounding scar tissue. This seems to be the most likely scenario to improve symptoms however a small number of patients opt to have new implants inserted that may be a different material, shape or texture. Although this may initially improve symptoms in the short term, it is generally advised that the implants are completely removed. If you are having implants removed to try and improve the symptoms associated with this condition, it is advisable that you try to eat healthy, decrease stress levels and get regular exercise to maximise the chances of a positive result being seen after surgery. These 3 things help to decrease the inflammation associated with BII and to promote overall healing.

I’m thinking of having implants – is anyone at particular risk of suffering with breast implant illness?

Although there is no hard evidence, there have been some suggestions that women who have a personal or family history of autoimmune diseases, allergies, IBS, migraines, fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue may have a greater risk of struggling with Breast implant illness. However there have been lots of women who feel they have BII but do not have a history of any of these conditions.

My final thoughts

If you are considering getting breast implants or replacing older implants that you had inserted a while ago then the likelihood is you will not experience any adverse reactions. According to the medical watchdog MHRA, the majority of more than a million women who have had breast implant surgery in the UK have not reported any adverse problems. However, as with any surgery, there are risks associated with the procedure. Any reputable surgeon will be open to discussing the possibility of Breast Implant Illness as well as any of the other risks associated with the procedure you are thinking about. When searching for a surgeon, its highly important you choose someone who is as open about these risks as they are about the benefits of surgery. If you have any doubts in your mind that your proposed surgeon does not take the risks seriously, find another one. Your health depends on it.

Melissa Davies, 35, of Coventry, was unhappy with her smile so spent £6,000 to have a veneer fitted at a Turkish clinic she found online.

She claims she was put under general anaesthetic for seven hours as dentists removed five of her teeth and carried out 14 root canals.

She woke with a nosebleed, her airwaves closing and her aunt crying and screaming while asking 'what have you done to her?'

Melissa Davies, 35 after getting her teeth done at a dental clinic on the Turkish coast

Before and after: Prior to the dental procedure, Melissa said she always struggled with her teeth and they looked 'horrible' so much so that she was willing to travel across the sea and shell out £6K to have them sorted - and claims she is now left in 'agony'

Melissa Davieshas been quoted up to £30,000 to have them fixed in the UK and spent £6,000 on the procedure already

Melissa said: 'All my life I've suffered with my teeth, they never looked straight and always looked horrible and I had no confidence.

'I did some research online and looked at videos to see if some celebrities had been there and I decided to go.

'They put me under for seven and a half hours and when I came around my auntie was screaming 'what have you done to her?'.

'My nose had started to bleed and my airwaves had started to close. I had what I would call a Tampax in my nose to stop the bleeding and a tube into the back of my throat to help me breathe.

'It felt like I'd been punched in the face for a week. I heard a crack when they pushed one of my teeth up.

'I felt a sharp bit (on the journey home) and looked to find a hairline crack on one of my back teeth.'

Melissa opened up on TikTok and the video went viral with 14 million views and over 8,000 comments, she isn't the only one on the social media site with a tooth related horror story

The 35-year-old, from Coventry, West Midlands, said she was put under for seven and a half hours as dentists removed five of her teeth and carried out 14 root canals

Weeks on from the procedure, Melissa has a hairline crack along the back of her teeth and feels like someone has 'shot her in the mouth'. She is still unable to eat or drink anything cold due to the damage.

She went to her dentist in the UK and was told she is likely to need specialist care which could cost up to £30,000.

Melissa added: 'I've tried to see three dentists but no one will treat me. If anything, I smile less since I went to Turkey.'

'It's like an aching, but as soon as you drink something cold it's like someone's shot me in the mouth. I couldn't drink any cold water during the heatwave. I'm in agony.'

Melissa claims the dental clinic offered to have a look at her teeth again but said she would have to pay for any costs including the treatment and travel.

She posted about her experience on TikTok last month where it has gained over 14million views.

After posting on TikTok Melissa was met with thanks from those who were considering the procedure, and people who had also been through the same experience got in touch to say it was 'the biggest mistake of their life'

The post also attracted more than 8,800 comments from viewers who were shocked by the clip.

One said: 'Thank you for sharing, I was actually going to do this....I won't now. I'm sorry this happened to you.'

Another wrote: 'I completely agree. It's the biggest mistake of my life, I've been in pain for five years and no UK dentist will touch them.'

A third commented: 'Wow I've been thinking about getting mine done for ages. Thank you so much for helping me make my decision, it would be one I'd regret.'

A fourth added: 'Thank you for speaking out.'

This isn't the first time that a Turkish dental clinic has come under scrutiny for allegedly botching a procedure.

One woman said she was left 'traumatised' in April this year after spending £6,850 only to have her gums ripped to shreds making her feel 'beaten up'.

Dentists have also recently warned punters seeking pearly whites against travelling to Turkey to get their dream smile.

Experts have issued warnings over the dangers which invasive oral surgery can bring.

A report by the British Dentist association recently revealed that 86 per cent of UK dentists surveyed reported they had treated cases that developed following problems abroad.

Dental tourism has been on the rise, as well as surgery tourism, as the lure of affordable prices are tempting Brits to shell out on plane fares to get costly procedures done for a fraction of the UK price.

Now, before I lay into amalgam (which I will) I should confess that there may be a slight conflict of interest on two counts:

I got some amalgam fillings in my early teens which have subsequently caused me no end of problems. I’m a dentist. I’m a private dentist who doesn’t use amalgam.

So, now I’ve confessed you might want to read on…

Amalgam is a mixture of metals that chemically react together to produce a compound. The main metal involved in this intimate exchange of electrons is mercury. Mercury accounts for 50% of the metal in amalgam; and pure mercury is highly poisonous.

According to the FDA (the American Food and Drug Administration), amalgam “releases low levels of mercury in the form of a vapor that can be inhaled and absorbed by the lungs. High levels of mercury vapor exposure are associated with adverse effects in the brain and the kidneys”. Nice. But don’t worry, they also state “Based on this evidence, FDA considers dental amalgam fillings safe for adults and children ages 6 and above”. Great! That’s helpful!!

So which is it? Is it safe? Or is it NOT safe? Well, the debate has gone on for decades and up to now there is no conclusive evidence that dental amalgam is in any way harmful to health. However, the use of dental amalgam has recently been banned in the UK in children under 15. In Sweden, the use of mercury was banned in 2009 – that’s TEN years ago.

Anyway, so there’s no proof that amalgam is harmful to your health, but is it harmful to your teeth? In a word, yes. In my opinion. Which I did say might be slightly biased.

Putting aside my now obvious dislike of the stuff, let’s just look at some FACTS about amalgam as a restorative dental material:"

MAGICAL DENTIST ....... If you are anxious about visiting the dentist please read until the end as I hope to put some of your fears to rest and confirm that you are absolutely in the best hands with Dr Shaila Patel - Central London (I really cannot tell you how amazing this woman is, but hopefully by the end of the review you will have an idea, so read on!)

To cut a long story short, I'd put off going to the dentist as I suffer from severe health anxiety and I just couldn't face it, until one day I felt a different sensation in my mouth, uh oh!

I was initially faced with finding a new dentist (my old one was great, but 600 miles away as i relocated) and I was suffocated with the thought that a new dentist might recommend a lot of work - its really hard to trust someone you just met, with something you might feel really vulnerable and frightened about, right?

I'd read a few reviews about Shaila that were really promising - especially in her approach to nervous patients and I booked in for a check up. From the instant I walked in I was greeted with a really welcoming and reassuring smile and in that moment, she wasn't my dentist, she was my friend and ally - I really felt Shaila could tell I'd been through the 'wars in my head' just to get through the door and she was in no rush to get me into the chair, she just wanted to talk and get to know me and understand my fears! (Tip: something that really worked for me was to write down on a bit paper all the things that I was scared of and I then showed it to Shaila and we discussed each fear on the page!)

The check up was great, I actually left feeling more relaxed than I went in even thought I was told I needed a filling! (Tip: sometimes its the fear of the unknown that makes it worse!) Shaila reassured me throughout the checkup and told me everything she was doing before doing it to ensure I was in agreement - it really felt that the check up was on my terms - which if your anxious, can make all the difference. She listened and she laughed with me and she lightened the mood entirely!

I knew I needed to return for the filling and was completely dreading it, Shaila was conscious of the impact this was having on me and encouraged a quick appointment to get it sorted rather than leaving it for a few weeks - that way it wouldn't be on my mind! Sheila also arranged a longer than normal appointment to ensure we would have time, to take out time! (wow!)

On my return I was encouraged to bring anything no matter how silly and so i rocked up with my big girl pants on with my hot water bottle and noise cancelling earphones!

Shaila numbed me up to get the procedure moving and this was the scariest part for me (a needle phobic!) She used this new technology called the wand which delivers pain free anaesthesia (I'd read some reviews about this new method of numbing, but didn't believe it would actually be pain free) Shaila was so precise I honestly didn't feel a thing not even a pinch (and I don't mean the pain was barely noticeable, it wasn't there at all!) After that, the procedure went to plan and a week later, my tooth feels no different to than it did before which is a tell tale sign of a great dentist!

I left Shaila's care feeling myself again, feeling relaxed and that not only had my oral health improved, but my mental health had improved too. This was clearly over and above Shailas job role, but how wonderful to find a dentist that works from the heart.

I can honestly say this was the best dental experience of my life (and I've had good experiences in the past - but this was extra special and thats not something I thought I would be saying about getting a filling!)

So from one anxious patient to another, if you are in 2 minds about going to the dentist and which dentist to choose, choose Dr Shaila Patel - Central London, she's pretty special!"

Dr Batavia shares how in his view a holistic dentist helps people “In my experience people feel nervous if they don‘t fully understand what is happening or why. In the same way, if patients don’t fully grasp the benefits and consequences of any treatment they will not feel in control of their health. Information puts patients in charge, they can then make the right decision for them.” He continues “It would be so easy to say you need 2 fillings and we can book you in to get them done. However, this does not address the bigger picture or the short, medium or long-term goals someone may have regarding their health and wellbeing.” We prefer to use what we call “Co-diagnosis and Co-treatment planning” rather than simply telling the patient what is needed and how and when it will be done. By discussing the findings and options available with the patient, exploring the pros and cons and making time to answer their questions, we help them to make the right decision. An additional benefit of this way of working is that when we draw conclusions we are also taking into account any other potential problems they may experience in the future. This results in a tailored service, with an actively engaged patient in control and fully informed at every stage. After treatment there is always the maintenance phase – once again the patient is in the driving seat - when we reinforce areas they need to keep an eye on and oral hygiene techniques they need to use. Dr Batavia concludes “All the added value – such as referrals to complementary health practitioners and information resources –result in so much more than just having a few dental problems being addressed until the next time they experience dental pain.” “As for all the fact-finding, well it helps in so many unforeseen ways. For example, we can give them breaks if the treatment is a long session – this particularly benefits someone who is nervous about seeing the dentist and goes a long way to ensuring their treatment is carried out successfully.”"

If you or a loved one are considering an abortion, you likely have a variety of questions about the procedure. Whether you want to know the process, possible risks or recovery, we have pulled together the answers to some of the most frequently asked questions here to inform and put your mind at ease.

What is an abortion?

An abortion is when a pregnancy is ended and does not result in a live birth. It is otherwise known as a termination of pregnancy. It should be noted that there is a difference between a spontaneous abortion (a miscarriage) and an induced abortion which is chosen for various medical and ethical reasons.

What is a legal abortion?

There are different laws regarding the right to legal abortion in the UK. The 1967 Abortion Act sets out the legal grounds for abortion in relation to England, Scotland and Wales only. This act states that an abortion is legal if the pregnancy is less than 24 weeks and two doctors agree that the abortion can be carried out. The two doctors need to agree that one or more of the following apply:

The woman’s life is at greater risk by continuing the pregnancy than by terminating it.

Terminating is necessary to prevent permanent injury to the woman’s physical or mental health.

There is a reasonable risk that if the child were born , it would suffer from serious physical or mental handicaps.

There is a reasonable risk that if the child were born, any existing children are more likely to suffer injury to their physical or mental health.

How doctors interpret the law will depend on their feelings about abortion. Some doctors may take the woman’s social and economic circumstances into consideration.

How many weeks can you have an abortion?

As mentioned, the majority of abortions will take place within 24 weeks of the pregnancy. However, a legal abortion can be obtained after 24 weeks, but these are relatively infrequent. An abortion can only go ahead after 24 weeks when two doctors have agreed there is a serious threat to the pregnant person’s life or in cases of serious foetal disability.

The Offences Against the Person Act of 1861 criminalises abortion in Northern Ireland. However, a legal abortion can be obtained in the most exceptional circumstances under the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013.

Who can have an abortion?

Any woman or girl, married or single, can have an abortion if the reason is one of those outlined in the law and the required number of doctors certify the procedure. If you have decided that you definitely want an abortion, say so firmly and explain your reasons.

When can a woman have an abortion?

As soon as a woman has missed a period, a pregnancy test should be done to confirm her pregnancy. As soon as pregnancy is confirmed, an abortion can be carried out as long as she is sure she does not want the pregnancy to continue. Very early abortions can occur soon after the woman has missed her first period.

Most hospitals and clinics will not consider termination beyond 18-20 weeks. If you are considering having an abortion, you should seek your doctor’s advice as soon as possible. An ultrasound scan is used to pinpoint the pregnancy’s exact stage. There are time limits to abortions, so the sooner you seek help, the better.

Where are abortions carried out, and who does them?

A qualified doctor must carry out abortions in an NHS hospital or a clinic/nursing home approved for abortions by the Department of Health.

When speaking to your GP, they may recommend an approved clinic that you should get in contact with if you express your wish to proceed with a termination. Alternatively, you may wish to do your own research. Approved and high-quality service providers with clinics across the UK include BPAS (British Pregnancy Advisory Service) and MSI United Kingdom. A simple phone call consultation will help you with the initial discussion and ensure you get booked in with a professional at one of their clean and safe clinics.

Can a doctor refuse to do an abortion?

The law in England, Wales and Scotland says that no doctor or nurse must help with an abortion if they have a moral objection to the procedure. Suppose your doctor will not consider your request for an abortion on personal, moral or religious grounds. In that case, you can ask to be referred to another doctor who is willing to give advice and help.

Alternatively, you may seek help and advice directly through an approved clinic, as we have already touched upon.

Is it easy to get an abortion?

The ease of having an abortion will depend on the reasons and how far into the pregnancy you are. Abortions up to about 12 weeks are a relatively simple operation. After this period, it becomes more complicated and risky for the woman. Because of the risks that may be involved, doctors are less likely to carry on with the request for an abortion after 12 weeks. If a woman lives in an area where it is not easy to get an N.H.S. abortion, it may be easier for her to pay the fees herself at a suitable private clinic.

In Northern Ireland, it is very difficult to get a legal abortion. In 2016 the Irish Department of Health said there were 25 legal abortions carried out in Ireland. While in the same year, 3,265 women travelled from Ireland to the UK for a termination. However, you can access free abortion care in England, and some clinics will help you to arrange travel and overnight accommodation to ensure you access safe care.

How much does it cost?

Most abortions undertaken in England, Wales and Scotland are provided free by the N.H.S. following a referral from two doctors. There are usually waiting times, but you shouldn’t have to wait more than two weeks from your initial appointment. In some areas, it may be challenging to get a free abortion, with very few consultants willing to accept abortion cases.

Some women choose to use a clinic run by an abortion charity or a private clinic to avoid this waiting period. Most can still offer an NHS–funded procedure if you are eligible. If you are paying privately, fees can vary from £300 to £2000 depending on the clinic, stage of pregnancy and the method used.

Is it confidential?

All doctors’ visits are confidential even in cases where the woman is under 16 years of age. All staff working at hospitals, clinics and surgeries are under strict confidentiality rules, and information about abortion does not go on your medical records.

Does a girl under 16 need to have her parent’s consent for an abortion?

If a girl under sixteen wanting an abortion shows she can understand what is involved in the process, she may give her own consent. The doctor will encourage the girl to involve her parents because they will need support emotionally and sometimes physically.

Some doctors are not prepared to undertake an abortion for a girl under sixteen without her parent’s consent. If the girl is certain she will not tell her parents, then the doctors will have to decide if the girl is mature enough to understand what she is doing. If the doctors do not believe the girl is mature enough, they will require a suitable guardian’s consent.

Anyone over sixteen has the right to consent to medical treatment, including abortion.

Does the father of the child have to give consent?

The law at present states the father’s consent is not needed for an abortion to be carried out.

Deciding to have an abortion

Whether you are certain you want to proceed with abortion or are having difficulty making a decision, you should be offered impartial advice and support from a trained pregnancy counsellor. This can be obtained from your GP practice, a counselling service at an abortion clinic or various organisations and charities such as BPAS, MSI UK, Brook, and NUPAS.

You may want to discuss the option of abortion with your partner, family or a friend. However, they will not have a say in the final decision.

How are abortions carried out?

There are two commonly used methods to terminate a pregnancy. These are referred to as a ‘medical abortion’ and a ‘surgical abortion’.

Medical abortion is when an abortion pill is used in the first nine weeks of pregnancy and does not involve any surgery. During a medical abortion, the woman is given a course of 2 different types of tablets. After taking the first tablets, the woman will have to return to the hospital or clinic 48 hours later to have the other tablet placed in her vagina (like a vaginal thrush pessary). These drugs usually result in the woman having a miscarriage within six hours. The woman will experience symptoms like a heavy and painful period.

Most abortions before 13 weeks are by ‘vacuum aspiration’ (the suction method). A local or general anaesthetic is required. During a vacuum aspiration abortion, a thin, round tube is eased into the uterus (womb) through the cervix – the passage that links the vagina to the womb. Suction is applied to remove the contents of the uterus, and the pregnancy is terminated. This method will not involve any stitches, so there is no wound. Most healthy women can go home the same day.

The type of abortion you are offered will depend upon the pregnancy’s length and the facilities available at your chosen hospital or clinic. There are a few other methods for later abortions, which your doctor will discuss with you.

What does a woman have to do after an abortion?

A visit to the doctor about two to three weeks after the abortion will be necessary to ensure all is well and to ensure the abortion is complete.

Most women feel well enough to return to work and other commitments a day or two after treatment. Sexual intercourse can resume as soon as they feel sufficiently recovered. Although it should be noted that a new pregnancy can occur immediately after treatment, contraception is advised.

How long do you bleed after an abortion?

The recovery from an uncomplicated abortion is usually fairly quick. Some women experience bleeding for one to two weeks after the procedure, and sanitary towels are recommended for use during this time. With surgical abortion, some women may not experience any bleeding until their next period, which is also normal.

Risks of an abortion

Most women will not experience any problems or issues when having an abortion. However, they are safer the earlier they are carried out. Please note there is a small risk of complications, such as:-

Infection of the womb (1 in every 10 abortions)

Some of the pregnancy remains in the womb (1 in every 20)

Excessive bleeding (1 in every 1000 abortions )

Damage to the cervix (1 in every 100 surgical abortions)

Damage to the womb (1 in every 250 to 1000 surgical abortions)

Does having an abortion affect your fertility?

Having an abortion should not affect a woman’s fertility.

You may experience some emotional problems. If you ever need to talk, your doctor or a professional counsellor will help as much as possible.

For further help and advice on an unplanned pregnancy or if you have concerns following an abortion, call British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) on 03457 30 40 30. The call will be charged at a local rate.

Read on to learn more about the wellness initiatives these six companies introduced and how they measured success.

1. Jack Wills

Jack Wills is a British fashion brand that designs preppy clothing for university students. They employ over 1,800 people and have stores in 320 locations.

To attract more staff that want a long-term retail career, Jack Wills have a complete benefits package that addresses every element of employee wellbeing. Their package aims to support the physical, mental, and financial health of their people.

Because the fashion world is constantly evolving, their employee benefits programme is flexible and in alignment with their younger staff demographic. Their people are a social bunch and having hundreds of discounts on their phones means they can save money on the go, and earn credit points while shopping on the high street with friends.

To nurture their teams’ mental wellbeing, Jack Wills also provides access to an EAP. Mental health benefits like these are invaluable when people feel anxious about personal issues, such as their finances, or work-related stress.

How has it worked Jack Wills? Well, after adopting a new holistic wellbeing package, they saw a 35% increase in candidate interest and their staff saved over £35,000.

2. The Gym Group

The Gym Group is a low-cost fitness business and has 95 gyms across the UK. Most employees work on the gym floor, so they are very aware of their physical health. Because of this, it’s important that their benefits promote a healthy lifestyle.

To motivate employees and keep turnover low, the Gym Group offers discounts on healthy recipe boxes, gym apparel, and supplements. Other health benefits include physiotherapists and online GPs, which are especially useful for personal trainers who need swift advice and treatment.

On days off, their employees enjoy discounted meals out and weekly treats, such as free coffees and snacks.

The Gym Group also offers employees an EAP, which they can use in complete confidence.

3. Purplebricks

Purplebricks is a UK tech-led estate agent that streamlines the experience of buying a property with a modern digital platform. As they have no high street branches, they can effortlessly scale up and grow their business. But scaling up brings its own unique set of challenges, especially when it comes to recruitment and retention.

Because Purplebricks is an agile company, they have a versatile employee experience programme, with plenty of benefits that cater to every aspect of employee wellbeing and health. Purple Bricks see themselves as digital innovators, so it’s important this filters through to all aspects of the business. From an employee benefits perspective, this means making sure their teams can access the programme whenever and wherever they want from a mobile app.

Whether it’s buying discounted shopping vouchers or booking an online therapy appointment, they can do everything quickly and easily from their phone. Being able to access hundreds of benefits on-demand not only makes people’s lives easier, but also increases the overall use and adoption of the wellbeing programme. A good user experience isn’t just about customers, but also your own employees.

In just six months since switching programmes, Purplebricks employees redeemed over 2,000 perks and saved over £20,000.

4. Wasabi

Wasabi is a popular high street food vendor that specialises in Japanese sushi and bento. With over 1,700 members of staff, they have multiple sites throughout the UK. Hospitality businesses often experience high turnover, but focusing on employee wellbeing can increase staff retention.

To reduce turnover and attract more talent, Wasabi have a flexible programme that adds value to their employees' lives. Their range of benefits includes hundreds of discounts on big brands, which incentivises their teams to use the platform and increases employee engagement.

Their employees can save money on holidays, hotels, and even trips to the cinema. Company culture is also improving after introducing a recognition scheme that rewards individual achievements.

Within 12 months of launching their new wellbeing programme, Wasabi achieved a 13% decrease in turnover.

5. Google

Google is the most popular search engine in the world, and because of this, their employees receive a very generous wellbeing package. It’s best to think of what Google offers as an inspiration for your own employee wellbeing package, rather than one to completely copy.

While many organisations offer staff discounts on lunches, all of the meals, snacks and drinks in Google canteens are free to employees and visitors. Google also regularly put on free cooking classes to bring teams together and strengthen working relationships. An excellent alternative for your employees could be something like a team-building day out or an office sports day.

Some Google offices also have gyms and massage therapists onsite, which people can use during their breaks. While not all businesses are in a position to offer this, another way of enhancing your team’s physical wellbeing is to provide online access to physiotherapists and discounted gym memberships.

Other Google benefits include free financial advice and therapy sessions. Introducing an EAP is a similar service, and a great way to invest in your employees’ financial and mental health.

6. National Health Service (NHS)

The NHS offers a compressive employee wellbeing package that supports mental, physical and financial wellbeing.

Like most companies, their staff have access to transport discount schemes, such as Cycle to Work and season ticket loans. However, the NHS discount scheme goes further, saving staff money on home and car insurance, as well as MOTs.

What the NHS does particularly well is recognising that their employees want flexible working. Depending on the person’s role, employees can choose what hours they work and when. People can also buy holiday days, topping up their annual leave when they are running low, and saving some tax and National Insurance in the process.

Similar to an EAP, the NHS offers counselling and other therapies for people who are experiencing problems in their mental health or just need to talk to someone outside of their support network. Given the nature of the NHS’s work, you would expect this level of wellbeing support for their staff, but it’s something all organisations can work towards."

161940,https://britishcondoms.uk/condoms-guide/,"Guide on condoms published by British Condoms, a company selling condoms in the UK.",True,The Ultimate Guide to Condoms,"Female condoms do have obvious, clear advantages one of which is the fact that they can be inserted up to four hours before intercourse.
As an alternative to latex, polyurethane is another reasonably common option for condoms and these condoms are a similar width and thickness to those made from latex.
These condoms are also less sensitive to heat and ultra-violet light so storage requirements are less stringent than for latex condoms.
For those who really hanker after something ‘au naturel’, lambskin condoms or natural membrane condoms could be an option.
Of course, the best place to buy condoms is Britishcondoms.ukJCondom testing, how can you be certain they are really safe?","female, ultimate, testing, sex, male, condoms, lube, stis, guide, latex, sexual, condom","Condoms are the only method of contraception that also protects against Sexually Transmitted Diseases – STIs - and other illnesses which can be transmitted during sexual intercourse including oral sex and anal sex, such as HIV Aids.

Take a look at some quick ‘at a glance’ facts and figures before we dive right into the nitty-gritty.

Condoms in varying forms have been around for several centuries; the principle of interrupting the flow of the man’s semen and the inevitable consequences were easily understood by many societies, even early man. Asian cave paintings would tend to imply a use that dates back centuries and condoms were first mentioned in print around the 16 th century

There are in fact two types of condom, one for the male and one for the female

Male condoms have a 98% strike rate protecting against unwanted pregnancies

A condom cannot be resued, they are designed to be ‘one use’ only

The majority of condoms are made of latex but if you are sensitive to latex or allergic to it, then there are alternatives made of polyurethane or polyisoprene

You can use water-based lubricants called ‘lube’ with all types of condoms, however oil-based products such as skin moisturiser or baby oil can affect both latex and polyisoprene condoms but are safe to combine with polyurethane condoms

How does the male condom work?

A condom is described as a ‘barrier’ method of contraception because a condom provides a physical barrier between male ejaculation and sperm-filled semen coming into contact with the female egg. It completely covers the male penis. Between male partners, the reproductive and contraceptive function of a condom is not relevant but it does serve as a barrier to prevent the exchange of bodily fluids during anal and oral sex and thereby protect against the transmission of Sexually Transmitted Infections or STIs as well as HIVAids. Condoms also serve this purpose in heterosexual relationships and are therefore the only product or method which has both a contraceptive and a disease prevention function.

How does the female condom work?

The female condom works along the same principles as the male equivalent and is inserted into the vagina rather than being placed over the man’s penis. Here are some key facts about female condoms:-

They have a lower protection rate than the male equivalent at 95%

They also protect against STIs as well as unwanted pregnancies.

Female condoms are placed in the vagina before sex but can be inserted earlier on in the proceedings than the male version, anything up to four hours ahead

Female condoms are also ‘one use’ only and cannot be reused after intercourse

They bear the same Kite mark and CE mark as the male version which acts as an assurance to the user of the quality of manufacture and production

How to use a male condom

Using a male condom correctly is key to its safety and effectiveness. A condom will not offer protection if it is used incorrectly, is damaged either before or during the process or is reused. This is how to use a male condom correctly:-

Ensure your condom is within date and has the appropriate safety/kite marks on the packaging

Open the packet carefully, do not tear open it with your teeth – tempting if your hands are slippery – or tear it with your fingernails or jewellery as you run the risk of actually ripping the condom inside

Most condoms have an obvious teat, hold it between your thumb and forefinger and slowly squeeze out the air. Leaving air in the reservoir at the end of the condom can cause it to burst during sexual intercourse

Place the condom over the tip of the penis and gently unroll it. The condom should unravel easily and with no resistance, if it doesn’t, then discard it immediately and try again with a fresh packet. The condom may essentially be upside down which is why it won’t unroll properly or it could already have some sperm on it, in either scenario, you should discard it

After ejaculation, keep a firm hold of the base of the condom whilst you withdraw to make sure the condom doesn’t slide off, it may already have moved down the penis towards the tip during the act of intercourse

Carefully remove the condom being vigilant about any spillages so that all the semen remains contained within the condom

Dispose of the condom in a bin and not down the toilet

Be careful as there can be a residue of sperm on the penis which needs to be kept away from the genital area

Each act of sexual intercourse needs a fresh condom

How to use a female condom

Some women prefer to use a female condom as it gives them more control of proceedings; they feel that this is not only safer but can get around standard male reasons and excuses not to use one. Female condoms do have obvious, clear advantages one of which is the fact that they can be inserted up to four hours before intercourse. Here is how to use a female condom correctly:-

Open the packet carefully being careful not to tear or rip it

There is a small ring at the closed end of the condom, squeeze it together and then insert into the vagina

The large opening at the other end of the condom should cover the area around the vagina

Be careful when the man inserts his penis to ensure it sits inside the condom and does not slide between the condom and the wall of the vagina. The female condom has a looser, less snug feeling so be certain that everything is in the right location

After intercourse, the condom should gently slide out, you can close off the business end by twisting it around to avoid leakages and spillage

Dispose of the condom in a bin, not the toilet

Always use a fresh condom each time you have sex

To Lube or not to Lube, that is the question?

Water-based lubricants are all fine in conjunction with both the male and female condom but oil-based products – essential massage oils, skin moisturisers, Vaseline or body lotions – are not recommended for use with latex or polyisoprene condoms because they can damage the integrity of the material. Most condoms are supplied with some lube on them but if you want to use additional lubrication or you have been enjoying massage oils then be careful what you combine with the condom. Anything that might affect the strength of the condom may make it more likely to split or rip.

What are the different materials that condoms can be made from?

Latex which is a natural form of rubber produced from the rubber tree is currently the most popular material used by condom manufacturers. Latex is actually the milky white sap produced by the rubber tree and is used prolifically in lots of products, not just condoms such as rubber bands, balloons, surgical gloves and novelty masks.

But Latex condoms are not without drawbacks in that they can adversely react with oil-based products which can be easy to overlook in the heat of the moment – sun cream, baby oil, essential oils, skin moisturisers – and this causes degradation of the material. Oil reduces the elasticity of latex and can cause the condom to slip or break and also, some people are actually allergic to latex.

However, there is no doubt that latex has remarkable tensile strength and elasticity which means it can be put under the most incredible pressure and force before it breaks which is why it has been such a popular choice for condom manufacturers.

In May 2009, the FDA in the States gave approval for condoms made of Vytex which is a form of latex from which 90% of the allergens known to produce an adverse response when in contact with the skin, had been removed.

As an alternative to latex, polyurethane is another reasonably common option for condoms and these condoms are a similar width and thickness to those made from latex. Polyurethane has some distinct advantages over latex in that is a better conductor of heat and this can really increase sensitivity and pleasure during the act of sexual intercourse. Polyurethane condoms can also be used with oil-based products and pleasingly, they lack the rather unpleasant and off-putting odour associated with latex. These condoms are also less sensitive to heat and ultra-violet light so storage requirements are less stringent than for latex condoms. But polyurethane is less elastic than latex so could potentially be more likely to break or tear; they don’t hold their shape as well as latex condoms and can bunch up which subjects them to a greater likelihood of damage.

Polyisoprene which is a relatively new material on the market is a synthetic version of latex. It is expensive but avoids the problem of latex allergies as it is absent the proteins which cause this reaction. It is soft and elastic and superior in this respect to polyurethane but cannot be used with oil-based products.

For those who really hanker after something ‘au naturel’, lambskin condoms or natural membrane condoms could be an option. They are made from sheep intestines and are definitely not a pick for the vegetarians and vegans. Intestines, by their very nature, are designed to be partially porous to allow the transmission of nutrients from the gut wall into the body’s bloodstream to be distributed around the body. Whilst sperm is unlikely to pass through these pores as sperm is simply too large, viruses may be able to pass across but as yet, there is not sufficient solid scientific data to either support or disprove this. As a consequence, it can be presumed that lambskin condoms will not provide total protection against STIs but could offer some protection and they will protect against unwanted pregnancies.

Latex allergies

Some people have an allergy to latex and this can be discovered through exposure to latex products like surgical gloves, not just condoms. Symptoms can include specific spots and a rash on any area of your skin which the latex has come into contact with so essentially, dermatitis, there may even be localised swelling at the site. But there can also be more generalised symptoms such as irritated and watery eyes, a runny nose and sneezing and potentially, some wheezing in the breathing. Very rarely, latex can produce a life-threatening reaction in some people a bit like an anaphylactic shock which some people suffer in reaction to certain foods like nuts.

Why don’t people like using condoms?

The main criticism levelled at condoms is that they can interrupt the sexual experience right at the optimum moment and, they can decrease the pleasure and sensitivity felt by both parties engaged in the act. These two factors but particularly the latter, are often touted as reasons or excuses not to use a condom amongst some people.

There are ways of counteracting the first problem by incorporating the putting on of a condom into sexual play so it doesn’t have to act as a hiatus during proceedings or a passion killer. However, lack of sensitivity is a trickier problem to tackle. For many men, this is just an ongoing gripe.

Researchers in the States have just produced a new condom lined with hydrogel, a water-based gel containing chemicals designed to kill the HIV virus in the event of a breakage. The gel also contains a revolutionary new antioxidant which is designed to enhance sexual pleasure by influencing the neurotransmitters which stimulate nerve endings. But here are some easy and quick solutions to improve the condom experience:-

Sexual play – incorporate condom application as part of the love making process. Have condoms ready to hand – a five-minute departure to the bathroom or further afield really can be a real turn off. Maintain safe intimacy whilst the condom is going on although reduce the temptation to rip the packet with your teeth as this can damage the condom inside as well as tasting pretty unpleasant

Lube – less friction and a smoother ride will undoubtedly improve sensitivity and enhance pleasure. Some condoms already come with lube but you can add more, just make sure you use the right type depending on the material the condom is made from. Silicone is a good option as it is thick and lasts longer than water-based alternatives. Avoid oil-based lube as in the heat of the moment, you don’t want to be groping around trying to read the condom packet to satisfy yourself of the identity of the material the condom is made from. Lube with a nice scent can get around that rather unpleasant, sterile odour that is associated with most condoms, one which is definitely not an enhancement to bedroom proceedings

It’s all about the position – certain positions offer greater depth and sensitivity than others, a simple change of arrangement can really increase pleasure even with a condom. Different positions alter the shape and dimensions of the vagina so can increase tension and tautness

Lack of sensitivity can have an upside: for rapid firers, a decrease in pleasure can make the whole encounter last a little longer!

More condom research to improve the experience

The use of condoms particularly amongst young people under the age of 25 who don’t perhaps quite perceive the risk from STIs is depressingly patchy and low; in a recent survey, almost half of the under 25s surveyed admitted to not using a condom with a new partner. So the quest to make the condom ever better continues amongst manufacturers and scientific research organisations. In third world countries, there is a life and death imperative so anything that can make the condom more desirable and popular has got to be a good thing.

Bill Gates, the Microsoft Supremo, has stepped down from his role running a global tech giant and, with his spouse, Melinda, is focusing more time on the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The Foundation works on global health and education initiatives and in 2013, threw down the gauntlet to condom manufacturers and any other interested parties, to develop the next generation of condom, condoms fit for the 21st century. Most of the entries for a slice of the money pie were aimed at condoms which gave more pleasure to the user as this equals a user who is much more likely to use a condom although some did focus on ease of application, another condom bugbear.

Entries to the project came in all sorts of guises and were truly international in range. One idea used hydrophilic polymers which, when in contact with moisture, become slippery to the touch removing the requirement to add more lube during sex. The substance seemed to transform into something with a remarkable slipperiness in the right conditions designed to keep going when other condoms would need more lube applied, all aimed at increasing sensation and pleasurability. The product has received favourable reports in the media and is just one example of a number of projects backed by the Gates Foundation to make condoms more loveable.

Why do condoms fail?

Condoms normally fail through misuse and human error. An in date, kite marked condom that is securely sealed in a packet should not have any inherent flaws or faults. Condoms undergo very extensive testing before they leave the factory. The commonest causes for condom failures and unwanted STIs and pregnancies are:-

Not using a condom every time you have sex, a condom may be used on the first occasion but subsequent encounters during the same time period often go without

The condom was damaged or torn whilst it was being removed from the packet

The condom is not correctly placed on the penis before intercourse

The condom is the wrong size resulting in a break or the condom slipping off altogether

The wrong lubricant was used damaging the integral structure of the condom material

The condom was not stored at the correct temperature

The condom is out of date

The condom is a cheap foreign import without quality assurance testing

But, with the best will in the world, condoms sometimes just do break or tear, the key thing is that the damage is noticed and then appropriate steps can be taken in terms of STI testing and emergency contraception to guard against unwanted pregnancy. There is one thing worse than a burst condom and that is a burst condom which has gone unnoticed.

What sexual diseases do condoms protect against?

Condoms are not a 100% guarantee against contracting sexual diseases, they simply reduce the risk of transmission. The only copper-bottomed way to ensure a zero risk of STIs is total abstinence from sex or sex with a very long-term and exclusive partner.

STIs are spread by vaginal, anal and oral sex but sensible condom usage will significantly reduce your chances of contracting one or more of the following:-

Genital herpes

Genital warts

Gonorrhoea

Chlamydia

Hepatitis B

HIV – Human Immunodeficiency Virus

Syphilis

Even with condom usage, regular testing for STIs is advisable particularly in scenarios of multiple partners or lots of casual sex.

One size most certainly does not fit all

Sizing isn’t really the first or even second thing that comes to mind when choosing a condom, after all, they are super elastic and designed to be snug so it’s hard to imagine a condom not fitting. But, there are size variations amongst condom manufacturers. Get the wrong size and you expose yourself not only to an unpleasant experience but the potential for a leak or even a break in the condom.

There is a well known and simple toilet roll test, not very scientific but a good starting point if you feel you need one. If an erect penis can fit into an empty cardboard toilet roll holder with room to spare, then this probably indicates a requirement for tight fit condoms. If the toilet roll is just comfortable then that user is possibly medium or standard size and if it's snug, then you will need a large sized condom. It’s quite important to play around (pun definitely intended!) and find a size and brand that suits you. Sizing is not standard so if you change manufacturer then you might need to go through a re-fitting process again. Some companies sell a multi-pack with different sizes to help you work out which is the best fit for you or trial packs so that you can experiment with varying lengths and widths.

Ribbed, flavoured and novelty condoms

There are lots of ways to entice customers to buy condoms, novelty presentation is certainly one way. Ribbed and dotted condoms which are said to increase stimulation and enhance sexual pleasure is another variation on the theme. Dressing condoms up in sexy, alluring packaging and creating either a saucy or a fun theme is very popular. Bear in mind that it is easy to get lured onto websites which are selling enticing condoms but the actual base product might not be up to specification or be subject to the same quality assurance so only purchase from reputable sites where there is a minimum standard of product, guaranteed.

Flavoured condoms are really only a thing for oral sex with all sorts of fruit berry and even cocktail varieties on offer. Again, you should only buy flavoured condoms from a reputable supplier in order to avoid cheap, foreign imported condoms that come with no quality assurance or testing and may offer little or no actual protection.

Where to buy condoms

Condoms can be bought from any high street chemist, online pharmacy or in supermarkets. Condoms are also available for free from some Doctor’s surgeries and sexual health and contraceptive clinics. A condom packet should display the British Standards Institute (BSI) kite mark plus the CE mark which is the European Union equivalent. This means that the condom has been manufactured in line with specific industry standards and guidelines and is tested to be safe to use. Condoms packets will have a ‘use by’ date so make sure that what your purchase is still within date. This reflects the fact that latex and the other materials all have a life after which it can degrade and the packaging could become less sealed and secure.

Of course, the best place to buy condoms is Britishcondoms.ukJ

Condom testing, how can you be certain they are really safe?

Condoms are subject to a range of tests by the manufacturer before they are released for sale. Electronic testing or individual testing as it is sometimes referred to, stretch the condom over a piece of metal and then uses either air or water to see if a current of electricity can affect the metal. If the condom is 100% water and airtight then the rubber will not act as a conductor indicating that there are no tiny holes or punctures in the condom invisible to the naked eye.

Condoms are tested individually within the factory and then batches are also selected at random for quality assurance review against a series of predetermined standards. Air Burst testing does just what it says on the tin; condoms are filled with air and their strength and capacity are measured just prior to the point of bursting. Leak testing assesses the condom for tiny pinholes which may be invisible to the viewer or tester. Condoms are filled with water and evaluated for tiny droplets or seepage both visibly and also against dry material which will expose holes too tiny for the human eye to spot. Tensile strength is tested by a machine although this test is usually only performed on condoms which are sold as ‘super strong’ or ‘extra strength’. Packets are also tested once the condom has been wrapped; they are vacuum packed and the wrapping should be intact, secure and undisturbed.

Condoms which don’t meet standards on all or any of these tests are discarded by the manufacturer. Testing procedures are both routine for all condoms and then there is additional random batch testing. Always satisfy yourself of the quality procedures in place before you purchase a condom. Manufacturers use different tests and sometimes it can be hard to spot the actual origin of a condom once you have clicked around online for a bit and hopped from one website to another.

Always aim to purchase condoms with the British kite mark and the CE logo for the European Union. The British kite mark is evidence of the British Standards Institute or BSI who independently sample products on a monthly basis to ensure they are compliant with defined standards of manufacture. The CE mark illustrates that the condom has met the standards prescribed by the Medical Device Directorate and is a European wide emblem; neither of these logos will appear on condoms which have been produced in third world countries like India or in China where they may be no quality control testing.

Keep Cool

Condoms should be stored in a cool location and be kept out of direct sunlight. They should also be stored in a place where they cannot be accidentally ripped or torn if you intend to carry packets around with you in a wallet or jacket pocket.

There is no doubt that condoms are universally famed both for their disadvantages and drawbacks as well as their unique ability to protect against both STIs and unwanted pregnancies. With the increase of modern materials constantly coming on to the market coupled with advances in scientific knowledge plus the interest and financial backing of heavyweights like the Gates Foundation, it is likely that condoms will only improve and lose their rather last century image. Nothing has yet replaced the condom in terms of its universal efficacy so expect condoms to be around for a long time to come"

Dentistry at the London 2012 Olympic Games

Did you enjoy watching the Olympics in Rio 2016 and Japan back on course for Summer 2021 - many congratulations to team GB - amazing effort from all those whether they won medals or not !!!

We take a keen interest in such progress because our own Dentist & Specialist* Dr Tony Kilcoyne, was selected from 1000s of Dental Professionals to look after the World's TOP ATHLETES for the Olympic Games London 2012, based right in the centre of the Olympic Village before and during the event.

Why not be treated personally by someone who was selected & trusted with the dental care of

all the World's best Athletes, worth £££Billions?

Interestingly in each day of the Olympics, the Olympic village daily magazine chose their Games-Maker of the day, on Friday 3rd August 2012 they chose:

Here at our Smile Specialist Centre in Haworth, Keighley, near Bradford and Leeds, the kind of bespoke precision dental work we do, is just like delicate keyhole surgery, where our decades of Experience with our high Expertise really matter & can really count!

Let Dr. Kilcoyne the expert smile dentist get it RIGHT for you, first time, every time, in the complex area of very high-tech, very high skills, Dentistry care.

EVERY new patient will get a full mouth examination, outline treatment plan with different prices and Options often on the FIRST visit - it is thus very important you book the right kind of examination for your needs, be it general dentistry, specific Cosmetic issues or Implant & Complex case consultations with us.

After the right examination with us, you will then have the information YOU need, to make an informed choice that best meets your needs, wishes and budget too - it is SO important to get the right Plan to follow and the initial Opinion and Treatment Options can make ALL the difference longer-term too.

One cannot do a complex examination for say Implants and discussion appointment taking us 1 hour to DO IT RIGHT, in only the general 30 mins slot or even worse, via a 'free' chat, so please don't try to do this compromise to save a few £££ - if you want 'free' information then read the extensive pages on this website = far more detailed and extensive info. than you'd normally get from an inadequate short 'free' chat - our website gets great reader/visitor feedback!

We book out the proper time and charge for our valuable Specialist Expertise, so please don't try to skimp on this vital first stage, it isn't just a very rushed 5 min check-up, but a VERY detailed examination and consultation that can help prevent future problems AND provide excellent longer-term solutions and choices for your dental health and attractive smile!

YOU ARE WORTH IT and we hope you feel our Dentist + Specialist Expertise and long track record is worth it too.

Care Quality Commission report on the Smile Specialist Centre

""Patients were positive about the care they received at the practice. Feedback commented how friendly, caring and attentive staff were at the practice.""





We have always placed a high importance in spending the time to care and improve dental health and smiles, as evidenced/recognised in our previous 2012 CQC positive report too:

Clearly, we place a high value on our Patient care and Clinical expertise, including at a Specialist level too. Please see below for just one example of a recent unsolicited thank-you card sent by a patient, treated by our caring team:

It is very important to go to a properly qualified Dental Professionals for Teeth Whitening who can examine your mouth before and after Teeth Whitening treatments after taking a full Medical History - beware Amateur Salons offering tooth Whitening services. The dangers aren't just to permanently damaging your teeth and gums, but also spreading diseases between patients (hepatitis, TB, herpes etc.) and into the community at large, as Salon Amateurs don't have to follow Dentists high standards in Training and Disease prevention or Sterilisation, which is why they seem generally cheaper of course, as well as being illegal now, for public safety reasons!

Want to know the Truth about NHS Dentistry problems & limitations

according to C4 Dispatches and wider media?

The Dentists tend to get 100% blame for a poorly planned and even more poorly resourced dental system - Dr.Tony Kilcoyne took part in this Investigative Programme to help expose 'The Big Lie' that NHS Dentistry can provide for ALL the clinical health needs for the population in England under current limitations. Dr.Kilcoyne says boldly the NHS Dental system simply is not fit for purpose, dental prevention is itself prevented and rotten teeth was the third most common MEDICAL reason for ANY young child to be in a Hospital bed overnight - he was concerned things would only get worse if proper action wasn't taken!



Well now it looks like Dr.Kilcoyne's previous concerns were valid and STILL ignored centrally, as since 2018 in England, STILL the No.1 medical reason any primary school child is hospitalised, remains rotten teeth in 2022 :(

Isn't it time HMG started listening to prevention & wisdom, instead of staying stuck in denial-mode ???

Want to know more about Cosmetic Dentistry?

There are many options to Cosmetically improve your smile. Dr.Kilcoyne the smile dentist can offer all of these and finds that after his detailed examination and discussion with patients, several options are usually combined to get the desired overall result at a reasonable price in an acceptable timescale. It is important to have an Expert plan and to do the right things in the right order too, For great long-term results, the Quality really does count! Many of our patients come from the Leeds - Manchester M62 areas for our Expertise.

Worried about Cheap Dentistry Abroad Dangers?

We all like to save money, but buying irreversible Surgical services as if they're disposable DVDs may damage your health beyond repair and cost a lot more again OR maybe not be fixable again at any price - it could result in the wrong Short-cuts, permanently!

It's ALWAYS better to save and get it done right the first time or prevent it going wrong or worsening of course.

Concerned? Then see the Possible Serious Dangers of Dentistry Abroad information page.

The title Dr. does not imply the possession of a Ph.D or acting as a medical practitioner - although Dr. courtesy title has been used freely in the UK since 1995 and in Europe, USA and Worldwide routinely to refer to all qualified Dentists as well as a courtesy title for all medical practitioners too, the Advertising Standards Authority is concerned that the UK population may not understand that 'Dr.Kilcoyne Dental Surgeon' type descriptions, means Dr.Kilcoyne is a Dentist and not a medical practitioner or a Ph.D in philosophy etc, so they request this is made clear, even though there's no credible evidence of public confusion after 20 years!!

We are a team of writers, experimenters and researchers providing you with the best advice with zero bias or partiality.

Vegetarianism and veganism – and more recently, flexitarianism – are just a few examples of diets that incorporate plant-based foods. While gaining more widespread popularity lately, plant-based foods have been around for thousands of years.

Plant-based food – as the name suggests – is food that comes from plant origins. This includes fruit and vegetables, as well as beans, cereals, grains and legumes.

Whether catering for those that opt for a completely vegan diet (no products from any animal sources), follow vegetarianism (no animal meat products), or those who occasionally eat meat or fish (flexitarianism), eating more plant-based foods isn’t just a growing, but an exploding trend.

There’s even a growing practice of freeganism – people who eat (vegan) food for free, whether it has been thrown out by retailers and food outlets, or is growing in the wild.

While plant-based diets themselves aren’t new, what is interesting is how mainstream they’re becoming, and that more men are looking at plant-based protein too – providing potentially profitable business ventures for entrepreneurs.

Last year, we told you that blue superfood algae was a key trend that you needed to know about – and in 2019, it’s time to embrace the whole rainbow of plant-based foods. Read on to find out why…

Why plant-based foods is a good business idea

As people are becoming more and more interested in the food they eat – including where it comes from, how it’s made, and what the effects of eating it are – plant-based foods are being increasingly recognised for their possible health benefits and eco-friendly footprint.

With vegan diets garnering press coverage from high profile media outlets – including the BBC writing about the rise of veganism, Forbes reporting on why businesses should turn vegan in 2018, and The Guardian commenting on veganism becoming mainstream – it’s clear to see that plant-based foods is a trend that’s at the top of many news agendas.

Plus, with Harvard Health Publishing discussing the benefits of eating more plants, plant-based foods have been recognised by established research institutions too.

Additionally, market trend reporter Mintel has named ‘evergreen consumption’ (the connection between suppliers and consumers throughout the production process, with a focus on sustainability) as one of its three key global food and drink trends for 2019.

But it’s not only official publications that are documenting it. At the time of writing, #plantbased had 18.9 million posts on Instagram, suggesting that people around the world are interested in the concept on a day-to-day basis.

And in addition to its international popularity, several British chains are now showing a commitment to catering for plant-based diets.

In 2017, Tesco appointed American chef Derek Sarno as its first director of plant-based innovation, while similarly, Pizza Express has introduced a number of vegan items into its menus throughout 2018.

So what do plant-based eaters actually eat? When thinking about plant-based foods, it’s easy to think that it’s all about fruits and vegetables.

While so-called ‘superfoods’ – such as berries, leafy greens, and the ingredient of the moment, watermelon seeds – can form a part of plant-based diets, there are a lot more elements to consider as well.

Crucially, there are a number of plant-based protein sources too, such as soy products (tofu, tempeh and edamame beans), lentils, nuts and chickpeas, to name a few.

In fact, by 2054, plant-based proteins could account for up to 33% of the overall protein market, according to Lux Research.

And as the plant-based protein market becomes more widely touted, it’s no longer just young women leading the vegan charge. 2019 will see a shift towards ‘masculine plant power’, offering a significant opportunity for businesses to capitalise on this less-exploited segment of the market.

With the likes of Formula 1 driver Lewis Hamilton, footballer Jermain Defoe, and boxer David Haye, all examples of athletes that are said to follow a vegan diet, plant-based foods show no sign of being knocked out any time soon.

Plant-based foods business opportunities

Aspiring start-up founders looking to launch a hospitality business could serve plant-based foods, whether that’s as takeaways from a food truck, or as more formal meals in a sit-down restaurant.

For example, food-truck-turned-restaurant (and Startups 100 2018 index-listed) The Vurger Co. offers traditional fast food fare that’s entirely plant-based, including burgers, fries and shakes.

According to Kantar Worldpanel, 29% of evening meals in the UK are veggie. Therefore, there could be opportunities in changing the way people shop for the food they eat at home.

One option could be to start an entirely plant-based or vegan supermarket – whether as an online-only retailer, a brick-and-mortar shop, or both. For example, GreenBay is a London-based vegan supermarket with an online store that also delivers across the UK.

Potential bar owners could take inspiration from Netherworld in Brisbane, Australia, an arcade bar where customers can play retro video and board games, and chow down on an entirely vegan menu that can be customised with meat or dairy options.

This canny approach to creating a menu is aimed at plant-based eaters, but also allows dishes to be modified for traditional diets. This inversion of classic pub food protocol allows plant-based eaters and meat eaters to dine together easily, and is a disruption that savvy British bar owners may want to use as inspiration.

Other business opportunities could exist in creating plant-based versions of international cuisines, whether to eat in a restaurant or at home – using African ingredients (a 2017 business idea), for example.

Similarly, potential start-up founders could consider moving into the subscription box business. For example, Mindful Chef (another Startups 100 2018-winning business) is a UK health food box company that delivers meal kits suitable for plant-based eaters and meat eaters alike.

Also, you could offer a combination of supermarket and subscription box services, like TheVeganKind, or get your product featured in such a service.

Alternatively, foodie entrepreneurs could consider non-service-based business opportunities and look to food production instead.

With many plant protein start-ups based in America, there could be a gap in the market for British would-be business owners to create similarly realistic meat substitutes. US-based Impossible Foods first launched its Impossible Burger – a plant-based burger that ‘bleeds’ – in 2016.

There could also be opportunities for businesses to position themselves within the masculine plant protein sector too.

As the trend for plant-based foods that accurately mimics its meat counterparts continues to grow, there could also be demand for plant protein powders to build muscle and fuel workouts, as part of a wider shift towards the rise of masculine plant protein.

For example, the publication of American vegan cookbook Thug Kitchen back in 2014, as well as the launch of Rudy’s Dirty Vegan Diner in London’s Camden Market in 2018, are two examples of vegan food being marketed in a more conventionally masculine way.

Insider opinion

Hannah Carter, founder of Alternative Foods, comments on the trend:

“It’s only recently that we’ve begun to understand the impact of our food choices over the last twenty years.

“We now understand that our health is being compromised by our high intake of animal protein and antibiotics injected into the animals we eat, and that the environment is also suffering as a result.

“Armed with this newly-acquired knowledge, it’s generally considered to be the younger generation who are driving the lifestyle choice towards adopting an increasingly plant-based diet.

“The concept of plant-based food alternatives is still in its infancy, however, and so – with the sector growing at an astonishing rate (plant-based food is currently Waitrose’s fastest growing line) – there are opportunities to be had for entrepreneurs in many areas.

“I believe the challenge is no longer simply catering for vegetarians, vegans and those with specific dietary requirements. Millions of consumers would like to help the environment and support animal welfare whilst eating healthily, but are loathe to make a significant change to the food they enjoy or increase their food costs.

“It’s up to entrepreneurs like us, therefore, to research plant-based alternatives that are as similar as possible in appearance, taste and price, to help the average consumer easily move over to this much healthier diet.”

Hannah McCollum, founder of ChicP, adds:

“The rise in popularity of plant-based food is hugely important. There’s more and more awareness on the environmental impact meat farming has, and the importance of eating more plant-based foods. With this, the trend of veganism has continued to grow, with more than 3.5 million vegans in Britain.

“It’s vital that consumers and food industry players make more changes to eating more sustainably because of climate change. Therefore, the more food business ideas that are plant-based and using food waste or by-products, the better – and I believe the easier it will be for those businesses to be successful.

“Most people are striving to be more sustainable in their everyday lives, and businesses are changing to follow suit.”

This is an open invitation. Contact me on Facebook, Twitter/X, LinkedIn or by email at peter@peter-reynolds.co.uk

My Speech at Cannabis Europa, 25th June 2024

Thank you chair, Mr Ellson, and thank you Mr Hitchens for coming to this debate. My respects to you for entering what must seem like the lion’s den.

I am here to explain why the current law against cannabis causes far more harm than it ever has or ever could. We have suffered under bad drugs policy in Britain since the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1928. The prohibition of drugs, including cannabis, has created criminal markets which have caused extraordinary harm to our society. I suggest that it is the worst failure of social policy since the war. Nothing else has impacted communities, divided the people from the police, like prohibition. This may be elevating drugs policy to higher importance than you have heard before but I consider that bad drugs policy, prohibition, is driving the breakdown of our society like nothing else. The problem is not cannabis, nor any drug. It is prohibition.

Now, I offered Mr Hitchens the opportunity to phrase the motion for this debate. I was ready to speak either for or against, however he wished it to be set.

So, ‘This house calls for the repeal of the laws against marijuana’ and I speak for the motion. It is the last time that you will hear me speak the ‘M’ word. I prefer the correct scientific and botanical term, cannabis.

But the ‘M’ word, or rather the use of it, is a very good place to start. It’s an Hispanic nickname for cannabis which was deliberately selected and promoted by the architects of cannabis prohibition in the USA, William Randolph Hearst, the newspaper magnate and Harry Anslinger, head of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, later to become the DEA.

They chose the ‘M’ word in order to associate cannabis with Mexicans and the perceived threat across America’s borders. How little has changed! They went so far as to even enshrine the word in US legislation. Transforming racially charged slang into statute. An extraordinary exercise in state propaganda..

So it was a racist meme from the beginning. Hearst’s newspapers published stories about Mexicans going insane, committing horrendous violence, sexually ravaging white American women and all of it was put down to cannabis. Again, it’s remarkable how little has changed. In Britain, the Mail newspapers continue this campaign of disinformation today.

I understand, of course, that language changes, develops but the choices we make are important and this history illustrates how the laws that currently exist are based on prejudice, misinformation and have nothing to do with science, health records or evidence of any sort. When that was tested by rigorous scientific method by David Nutt and his team, the Labour government had him sacked for it. That’s how deep this falsehood runs

So, as the motion states, I would repeal the laws against cannabis and I would replace them with laws that seek to control and regulate it.

Some argue that cannabis should be treated like carrots or cabbages. If we could go back to beginning of the 20th Century, I would agree. There are many plants in our gardens far more harmful than cannabis but 100 years of bad drugs policy, of prohibition, have created and supported a gangster-driven criminal market which we cannot walk away from. For the safety of our society, the cannabis market has to be regulated – not to protect us from cannabis but from the violent criminal trade in it.

I do not suggest that cannabis is harmless. No one with any sense claims that it is. But it has many benefits. Not just as medicine but as something that can bring great pleasure, insight and joy. It can enhance life experiences such as music, food, all forms of culture, spirituality and relationships. It is unique in this regard. I like to think of it as a condiment for life. It enhances and develops all the flavours of life and although those of us who consume it understand this, these benefits are largely obscured by the hysteria and falsehood around it.

Clearly, excessive or irresponsible use can cause health harms, as with any substance. The most vulnerable are children and that’s why the principle role of the law must be to protect them. As for adults, they should in my view be able to consume anything they wish without restriction under law – unless of course they cause harm to someone else. And we already have all the laws we need to protect others without banning personal possession or use of any drug.

The main harms to children are around brain health but in mature adults, science shows exactly the opposite, that cannabis is neuroprotective, promotes neurogenesis and is a prophylactic for brain injury either through trauma, stroke or neurodegenerative disease. Professor Gary Wenk of Ohio State University says that regular, moderate use of cannabis in middle age will delay the onset of dementia so effectively that most people will never experience it

So it is with protecting children that the law should be concerned. Yet what we have seen, beyond doubt, is that the effect of the law has been exactly the opposite. The laws against cannabis are the principle cause of its harm to children. Because it is prohibited, it is easier for children to get hold of it than the drugs that we regulate, alcohol and tobacco.

The criminal market in cannabis drives street dealing, sales to children, the exploitation of children as runners and it inveigles them into gang culture and county lines. I suggest that cannabis prohibition is the root cause of most knife crime. It and the prohibition of other more dangerous drugs is the cause of most crime and violence in Britain. There is no dispute about this. Over 70% of people in prison are there for drug-related crime. Police spend most of their time on drug-related matters. We have created this huge edifice of drug crime which now overwhelms everything else. Globally we have created the biggest ever criminal market worth, 10 years ago, in 2014, $652 billion. We have done this deliberately. It is stupidity beyond belief.

It is because of this huge, overwhelming weight of drug-related crime that our police have no time for real wrongdoing, for burglary, rape or fraud. And this is a choice we have made. There is no inherent wrong in cannabis. It’s just a plant. We have obsessed over ‘malum prohibitum’, that is a wrong that we have invented, at the expense of ‘malum per se’, that is something that is inherently wrong, in itself, such as theft or assault.

The demand for cannabis is huge. According to the largest ever study on the subject, we consume more than 2800 kilos of it every single day in Britain. It’s utterly naïve and absurd to think this demand can be turned off or suppressed – and indeed, why should it be for consenting adults? It’s the futile attempt to suppress it that causes so much harm.

And let’s be clear, even though the cannabis laws are barely enforced at a personal level now – thank heavens the police recognise what a waste of their resources it is – prohibition still supports and promotes the criminal market and all the harm it causes and the other crime it finances. As I set out in my book, ‘100 year of Bad Drugs Policy’, to be published next year, the cannabis market is the most reliable source of regular cashflow for criminal gangs. It incorporates human trafficking, modern slavery, child exploitation and

funds the smaller but much more profitable trade in heroin and crack. It provides the working capital for every other type of crime you can imagine. And all because politicians, enjoying their taxpayer-subsidised drug consumption rooms in Parliament, have decided, on the basis of no evidence at all, that you should be stopped from enjoying a joint or a brownie or easing your aches and pains without the bother or expense of a prescription.

So how do we regulate cannabis? I have already published a great deal on this, so has Transform, so have Conservative think tanks, so have Labour think tanks, the Liberal Democrats, the Green Party and others. And now we have the real-world experience of dozens of US states, Canada, the Netherlands, Malta, Luxembourg and Germany. We have a huge quantity of evidence.

Of course, there have been mistakes. California’s greedy politicians tried to impose taxation at a ludicrous rate which only supported the illicit market. They’re now fixing ii but as in all of this it’s unrealistic to expect immediate results. Undoing the harm of 100 years of prohibition takes time. But in Colorado, 12 years since legalisation, teenage use is now down 30%. 30%! In Canada, after just six years, 82% of all purchases are now made through legal channels. These are amazing achievements, which fully vindicate legalisation – and we, in Britain, have the opportunity to do even better!

So we have to repeal these laws against cannabis. They cause so much harm and our fears of dire consequences are illusory and now proven to be so by actual experience.

All we are currently doing is wasting time, our own time, police time, the time of the courts, the probation service and the time of all the people who are being hurt by the consequences of prohibition. And the money we are wasting, the lives we are wrecking, the terrible waste that this ludicrous policy causes every day is a tragedy.

These are my arguments for why we should repeal the laws against cannabis. I have more to add but now it is time for us to hear from Mr Hitchens."

The views about long COVID in children were collected from seven young people aged 13- to 18-years-old, five families whose children, aged 10- to 16-years-old, have long COVID or suspected long COVID, and four GPs and three paediatricians, between 9 March and 30 April 2021.

Prevalence and long-term impact of long COVID in childrenIt is not known how many children have or will develop long COVID.","schools, study, symptoms, understood, covid, doctors, infection, uk, health, long, children, covid19, poorly","The clinical definition of long COVID in children is at present very limited and poorly understood by doctors, according to a new report published today [21 July]. The report also found that symptoms typically associated with long COVID were having a significant physical and psychological impact on children’s day-to-day lives. Long COVID is commonly used to describe signs and symptoms that continue or develop after acute COVID‑19.

The report, led by the University of Bristol, is the first step in a COVID-19 testing in schools study to obtain opinions and experiences of long COVID from different groups of people.

‘Enhancing the utilization of COVID-19 testing in schools’ is an ongoing Health Data Research UK (HDR UK), Office for National Statistics and UK Research and Innovation (UKRI)-funded study that will bring together the Bristol-based COVID-19 Mapping and Mitigation in Schools (CoMMinS)1 study, Electronic Patient Records, and the COVID-19 Schools Infection Survey (SIS)2 to address additional questions not initially included in the individual studies. One of these questions is the extent and features of long COVID in children.

The views about long COVID in children were collected from seven young people aged 13- to 18-years-old, five families whose children, aged 10- to 16-years-old, have long COVID or suspected long COVID, and four GPs and three paediatricians, between 9 March and 30 April 2021.

Diagnosis of long COVID in children

Doctors said that long COVID in children is not well defined, and it may be difficult to distinguish between long COVID and other conditions. Doctors still need to understand whether long COVID is a new condition, or a group of conditions like post-viral fatigue, which is already recognised and can arise after common infections, such as the flu and glandular fever.

Symptoms of long COVID in children

Young people, and families of children with long COVID or suspected long COVID, said that feeling sick or stomach pain, extreme tiredness, and headaches were the symptoms they would rank as most ‘harmful’.

The families also said their children were experiencing many, and often very severe, symptoms of long COVID, and that the symptoms experienced were more wide-ranging than those currently listed on the NHS website for long COVID. It is not yet clear what is causing the unusual symptoms.

Prevalence and long-term impact of long COVID in children

It is not known how many children have or will develop long COVID. To date, studies that have attempted to measure this suggest it is rare, however, a lack of clinical understanding of long COVID including no agreed clinical definition has made this difficult.

The families said they had struggled to get a diagnosis and treatment for their children. They also said that long COVID symptoms were having a significant impact on their children’s day-to-day lives both physically and psychologically, and that some of the children had missed school because of the symptoms. Families wanted to know why the set of symptoms were being experienced, and why their children in particular had developed them.

Asymptomatic infections and long COVID

Young people were concerned about not showing COVID-19 symptoms and passing the infection to older or vulnerable people without realising. The risk of long-term health outcomes among children with COVID-19 infection could be overestimated if those events are more likely with severe COVID-19 infection, and severe infection is more likely to be diagnosed.

Re-infection

Re-infection in children is possible but very rare. Even so, how often re-infection happens might be underestimated if infections are not always recorded. Young people thought that there needed to be more awareness of the possibility of re-infection. There was also concern among families about the impact of re-infection on long COVID symptoms.

Caroline Relton, Professor of Epigenetic Epidemiology and Director of the Bristol Population Health Science Institute at the University of Bristol, joint lead for CoMMinS and one of the lead authors of the report, explained: ""The opinions we gathered further highlight that it is difficult to count the number of children with long COVID on the basis of diagnoses alone while long COVID in children remains poorly defined.

""There are added complications of studying long COVID in children, when it is sometimes difficult to disentangle what might be the result of experiencing infection from what might result from the wider impact of experiencing the pandemic. Isolation, school closures, disrupted education and other influences on family life could all have health consequences. Defining the extent of the problem in children and the root causes will be essential to helping provide the right treatment and to aid the recovery of young people who are suffering.""

Andrew Morris, Director of Health Data Research UK (HDR UK), said: ""This study demonstrates a significant step in helping expand our understanding of COVID-19 in school children and is another terrific example of why access to health data is crucial for vital research that informs the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The HDR UK and ONS National Core Studies have supported the UK Health Innovation Gateway to provide a common entry point for researchers to discover and request access to UK health datasets for vital research that is improving people's lives.""

Professor Punam Mangtani , co-investigator of the Schools Infection Survey (SIS) at LSHTM, added: ""It's fantastic to see the data from our landmark study being used in other valuable work, helping us learn more about the impact on COVID-19 on children in the UK. SIS helped us to understand the transmission of COVID-19 within schools and between schools and the community but, as demonstrated here, the rich data collected will have use far beyond our study.""

Dr Shamez Ladhani, Consultant Paediatrician at PHE and study lead for the Schools Infection Survey (SIS), said: ""The Schools Infection Survey has provided important evidence of the risk of COVID-19 transmission in schools among students and staff.

""The study has also established a well-defined group of students and staff for follow-up. This provides a unique opportunity to develop our understanding around long COVID in children.""

The report, which will feed into the COVID-19 testing in schools study, suggests that looking at GP and hospital visits, and school attendance, could be a more useful and achievable way of assessing how COVID-19 has affected children. However, there needs to be awareness of the extent to which healthcare is accessed according to need, and absence from school due to self-isolation, which will affect what is being measured. Also, the impact on children with milder symptoms could be missed. Feeling sick or stomach pain, extreme tiredness, and headaches will be important symptoms to consider in the study. The study researchers will also need to bear in mind that some health measures such as asymptomatic infection and re-infections are not always recorded as not everyone with COVID-19 infection is necessarily tested.

In the UK, the time in which it takes to diagnose childhood, teenage and young adult cancer lags behind other high-income countries; this delay worsens patient outcomes.

Funded by a Cancer Research UK Early Detection and Diagnosis Project Award, Dr Defne Saatci and Professor Julia Hippisley-Cox are exploring QResearch data to identify the early symptoms and signs associated with a subsequent diagnosis of most cancers in young people.

Detecting cancer in children and young adults in sub-Saharan Africa

Currently, 95% of global child lymphoma blood cancer cases are found in sub-Saharan Africa. A subset of these, called Epstein-Barr Virus-related (EBV) lymphomas, are particularly aggressive. This is the focus of AI-REAL, the global health program established by researchers at the University of Oxford.

Funded by the NIHR, the Aggressive Infection-Related East Africa Lymphoma (AI-REAL) project led by Professor Anna Schuh aims to bring the next generation of diagnostic technology to Tanzania and Uganda. They plan to improve the testing process for EBV lymphomas, subsequently increasing the chances of children’s early diagnosis and survival.

In partnership with four hospitals, new equipment has been installed and training programmes established. Live-streaming technology is used to share clinical knowledge with counterparts in Uganda and Tanzania.

‘ The aim is not just to improve the diagnosis for these children, but also to build capacity so that DNA-based cancer diagnostics can be used across the board in sub-Saharan Africa ’ Professor Anna Schuh, Director of the Oxford NHS/BRC Molecular Diagnostics Centre

The project, whose main research site is located in Northern Uganda, has created around 30 jobs for doctors, nurses, bioinformaticians and postgraduate students in health economics, biology and oncology.

In August 2022, the project conducted its first early diagnosis using liquid biopsy technology. A four-year-old from a remote area of Northern Uganda was diagnosed with Burkitt Lymphoma.

She was the very first patient recruited at Lacor, one of the four hospital sites, and is responding well to treatment.

Understanding how childhood cancer develops

A method 20 years in the making could lead to the development of new treatments for infant Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL).

ALL is a cancer that affects white blood cells; it is one of the most common childhood cancers. Since the 1970s, mortality rates for ALL have decreased by almost half, and survival rates for children have risen to 90%. Unfortunately, for babies under one, ALL is more aggressive and less responsive to treatment – only 50–60% can be cured.

‘ For the first time, we have a model where we can carefully map out the molecular details of this aggressive disease ’ Professor Thomas Milne, Associate Professor of Haematology

Professor Anindita Roy says that infant ALL has a unique biology, likely dependent on specific developmental features of the prenatal cells it arises in.

The breakthrough, made by researchers from the Roy, Roberts and Milne groups, focused on a genetic change found in around 70% of infant ALL cases, in which chromosomes become rearranged. The researchers were able to accurately replicate the clinical and molecular features of infant ALL, as well as shed light on why infant leukaemia is more aggressive.

Funded by the Medical Research Council (MRC), Blood Cancer UK, Wellcome and funding to individual authors, it’s hoped that the model will facilitate further insights into infant ALL, and be an essential preclinical tool that can manipulate vulnerabilities in infant ALL cells, and test novel therapies.

Work by Professor Irene Roberts, Professor Thomas Milne and Professor Anindita Roy is also supported by the NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre.

‘ We know this will ultimately help researchers develop better ways of treating, or even preventing, leukaemia in these children ’ Professor Irene Roberts, Emeritus Professor of Paediatric Haematology

Professors Irene Roberts and Anindita Roy – both of the MRC Molecular Haematology Unit, the MRC Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine and the Department of Paediatrics – have also produced detailed analysis of the prenatal development of blood and immune cells in bone marrow.

Part of the Human Cell Atlas initiative to provide comprehensive reference maps of every human cell type, researchers from a number of institutions have pinpointed a 6–7 week window during the second trimester of pregnancy in which the full range of blood and immune cells are established in bone marrow.

For researchers exploring the blood and immune systems, this data will be a valuable reference, especially for those investigating the changes in the processes that lead to diseases such as cancer.

According to Professor Irene Roberts, the study characterises some of the differences in gene expression in the bone marrow, which will help researchers to figure out whether these differences are significant, and in what way.

For Professor Andi Roy, the project has also been important because of how the researchers have shown the utility of datasets in understanding the effects on human health of perturbed blood cell production processes.

This particular research was again funded by Wellcome and the MRC, with the work of Professor Irene Roberts and Professor Andi Roy being funded by the NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre."

Learn more about gastrostomies

The gastrostomy tract is healing. The scar at the medial side of the tract and the vertical lines suggest that this may have been a surgically inserted gastrostomy rather than a true PEG (percutaneous, endoscopic gastrostomy). There is some redness around the tract and a small amount of discolouration on the dressing which suggests there might be some leakage or maybe infection. The tube appears to be a 'PEG tube' (e.g. a Freak PEG tube) which is held in place by a plastic disc in the stomach and a plastic retainer on the outside which can be seen under the dressing. It is important that once the tract has healed these tubes are 'exercised' every week - the outside retainer is released, the tube is pushed in several (4-5) cm and then drawn back until snug and the retainer is re-secured. This helps prevent a buried bumper - where the stomach lining grows over the plastic disc on the inside and often needs to be retrieved with an open operation.

Tim was also kind enough to write the foreword to my new book The Sourdough School Sweet Baking.

Did you catch this incredible webinar this evening? Tim and the team at ZOE shared the results of their recent PREDICT 1 study, which has been published today: Microbiome connections with host metabolism and habitual diet from 1,098 deeply phenotyped individuals. This research has identified “good” and “bad” microbes in the gut and related them directly to diet and health. This is an unprecedented study; the largest of its kind and it is ongoing – if you are in the US, you can do an at-home test and follow their programme on an app for personalised advice. In the UK, it is hoped this will be available later this year. Through cutting-edge technology, including metagenome sequencing, the team have begun to disentangle the relationships between the gut microbiome, food and health, and shown how one person can respond to a particular food very differently to another. I would say this is particularly relevant when studying gluten.

Here is an extract from Tim’s amazing recent book Spoon-Fed: Why Almost Everything We’ve Been Told About Food Is Wrong.

The Gluten-Free Fad

Myth: Gluten is dangerous

Over the past decade, gluten has acquired a bad reputation. Everyone, regardless of expertise, seems to have an opinion, with celebrities, doctors and nutritionists labelling gluten as unhealthy, unnecessary and potentially dangerous. The wealth of misinformation circulating about gluten and the dearth of good advice on nutrition from professionals has led to the rise in popularity of gluten-free and low-gluten diets. The food industry sees this as a lucrative new market, one currently worth at least $17 billion globally and growing at about 10 per cent a year. With enormous profits at stake, the power of money subtly shapes and influences the debate.

Many of the grains that are typical in most of the world’s diets (wheat, rye, barley and oats) contain a protein called gluten. Gluten, which means glue in Latin, is a mix of two smaller storage proteins, gliadin (which gives dough its plasticity) and glutenin (which makes it elastic). Gluten is formed when water is mixed with flour, and it gives dough its characteristic texture, elasticity and shape. These properties can be altered by fermentation, salt, or changing acidity or moisture.

Without a doubt, gluten is a baker’s friend, and it is one of the most consumed proteins in the world. It’s everywhere. In bread, pasta, pastries, biscuits as well as less obvious sources such as beer, soy sauce and gravy. But for a very small minority (less than 1 per cent) of the population, there is no choice but to avoid all sources of gluten due to a medical diagnosis of coeliac disease or, even more rarely, a wheat allergy. Coeliac disease is a proven allergy to gluten; it is an autoimmune disease where your own immune system attacks your tissues when you eat gluten. Even the smallest morsel of gluten can cause a sufferer to experience a catalogue of debilitating and unpleasant symptoms, including severe diarrhoea, vomiting, severe weight loss, fatigue and anaemia.

Despite the current popularity of gluten-free diets (GF), there is no good evidence that avoiding wheat is good for you. Contrary to popular belief, a recent large follow-up study found that long-term dietary intake of gluten is not associated with increased risk of heart disease; conversely, the study found that restriction of gluten led to suboptimal dietary intake of heart-healthy wholegrains, which could increase the risk of heart disease.1 This study of 100,000 US health professionals, conducted over twenty-six years, found that those with the lowest gluten intakes had a 15 per cent higher chance of having a heart attack. Although observational and so potentially biased, it seems that the extra stress of being on a ‘healthy’ gluten-free diet may not be good for your heart health after all. Approximately one in ten Brits now say they follow a gluten-free diet, and these figures are even higher in the US, despite less than one in a hundred carrying a medically confirmed diagnosis of coeliac disease. Surveys also show that although most people have heard of gluten-free diets, only 20–50 per cent of people have a clear idea what gluten actually is. Many of these are attempting to follow gluten-free diets, despite lacking this crucial piece of information.

To complicate matters further, people with symptoms triggered by gluten who do not meet the diagnostic criteria for coeliac disease may have a controversial condition – Non-Coeliac Gluten Sensitivity (NCGS), a newly established disorder that still lacks a clear clinical definition or diagnostic diet for six weeks to see if your symptoms disappear and then, crucially, reintroduce gluten into your diet to test whether it is really the culprit. Be warned, though, your chances of being right about gluten are slim. An Italian study in 2015 followed 392 self-reported sufferers of gluten intolerance for two years, asking them to cut out gluten, and then re-introduce it into their diets: 6 per cent had some evidence of coeliac disease; 7 per cent met the criteria for non-coeliac gluten sensitivity; and only one in two hundred had a rare wheat allergy. This left over eight out of ten people who, despite complaining of symptoms after consuming gluten and labelling themselves as gluten intolerant, suffered no obvious adverse effects from the consumption of gluten or wheat. So while gluten sensitivity probably exists in some form, it’s far rarer than we’re led to believe.

Others may feel better on a gluten-free diet because by avoiding gluten, they also eliminate other troublesome foods from their diet, such as beer, wheat and rye… If, after ruling out coeliac disease, you suffer digestive problems and still suspect gluten, you may wish to try a gluten-free cause digestive problems in people with IBS. Some people benefit from gluten-free diets as they have to think more carefully about what they are eating, and thus choose healthier foods and avoid random snacking. The benefits will depend on how good or bad your regular starting diet was. This is a similar phenomenon to what many people experience when they try going vegetarian or vegan for the first time. Generally speaking, if you believe a food will make you feel ill or better, the chances are it will, at least in the short term. As people rely more and more on the advice of so-called experts on social media, their diets are becoming increasingly restricted as various different food groups are deemed dangerous or unhealthy based on limited scientific evidence.

While a gluten-free diet may help alleviate symptoms in some people, for others it can lead to nutritional problems. Gluten-free products are typically lacking in vitamin B12, folate, zinc, magnesium, selenium and calcium. Other studies found that gluten-free diets in Spain contained on average more fat and less fibre than comparable diets. It is clear that excluding an entire food group from your diet can reduce fibre and dietary diversity, which also affects our gut microbes, creating the possibility of long-term adverse effects.

The large-scale studies suggest that, if anything, eating grains is associated with a lower risk of health problems and obesity. If you need further convincing that it is safe for 99 per cent of us to eat wholegrains, a recent randomised trial in sixty Danish adults for eight weeks found that a diet rich in wholegrains containing gluten reduced both body weight and blood markers of stress (inflammation) in comparison to those on a diet of refined grains.7 If you experiment and change your diet, be aware that any benefits experienced are unlikely to be due to the gluten itself. Unless you have a medically confirmed diagnosis of coeliac disease or a rare wheat allergy, avoiding gluten is likely ‘on average’ to do you more harm than good.

A new type of immunotherapy making use of the immune system’s ‘natural killer cells’ could offer potential against a range of cancers that can evade current treatments, early results from a phase I trial suggest.

Researchers found the new immunotherapy showed signs of effectiveness in a third of patients with a range of advanced cancers that had stopped responding to standard treatment, including bowel and lung cancers.

The immunotherapy, known as AFM24, redirects the body’s own natural killer cells and engages them to kill tumour cells, without having to go through a complex process to re-engineer a patient’s own cells, as happens with CAR-T cell therapy.

The researchers believe the new treatment has the potential to be safer and less complex than cell therapies like CAR-T, and might also work against a wider range of cancer types.

Ongoing phase I trial

An international team including researchers at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, and The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust assessed the new treatment in 24 patients initially in the ongoing phase I trial.

Early findings are being presented at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting 2022.

The trial, funded by the drug’s manufacturer Affimed N.V., is testing the immunotherapy’s safety and appropriate dosage, as well as its efficacy in solid tumours positive for EGFR – a key protein often involved in cancer growth.

A third of patients evaluated (8 out of 24) responded to the immunotherapy and saw their cancer stop growing after being treated with AFM24. This is a promising finding for a phase I clinical trial, as early-phase trials are typically run in patients who have very advanced cancers as a last resort.

Our researchers regularly present their latest findings at the AACR Annual Meeting in the US.

Find out more about the AACR conference

Patients saw their cancer shrink or stop growing

Two patients with bowel cancer and one with lung cancer who received the immunotherapy saw their cancer shrink or stop growing for more than three months.

AFM24, administered intravenously, was generally well tolerated by patients and the researchers were able to recommend a dose for further evaluation.

The immunotherapy has a ‘warhead’ targeted at EGFR, which is commonly produced by lung, bowel, kidney, stomach, pancreatic and biliary cancers. The treatment works by activating natural killer cells, immune cells that release toxic molecules to kill tumour cells, and directing them to cancer cells expressing EGFR – increasing their ability to selectively kill cancer cells.

The next phase of this study will further evaluate the effectiveness of AFM24 and is now ongoing. Further studies have also been launched to evaluate AFM24 in combination with other immunotherapies such as atezolizumab to target EGFR-positive tumours.

Immunotherapy shows signs of effectiveness

The trial’s UK lead Dr Juanita Lopez, Clinical Researcher at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, and Consultant Medical Oncologist at The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, said:

“Natural killer cells are an essential part of the immune system and are able to recognise cancer cells. This new immunotherapy, AFM24, can redirect natural killer cells to tumours by targeting a protein called EGFR, which is often found on the surface of cancer cells. Our early findings suggest it shows signs of effectiveness in some patients with very advanced cancers who have stopped responding to conventional treatments.

“This treatment is still highly experimental and our trial is at an early stage, but we are excited by its potential. It does not have to be personalised for each patient like CAR-T cell therapy, so it could potentially be cheaper and faster to use, and might work against a wider range of cancers.”

'Highly innovative'

Professor Kristian Helin, Chief Executive of The Institute of Cancer Research, London, said:

“We have seen major strides in the use of immunotherapy for cancer over recent years, with particular excitement over the use of ‘cell therapies’ to direct immune cells at tumours, often by engineering a patient’s own cells.

“This new treatment is highly innovative because it finds a way to direct natural killer cells within the immune system to tumours without requiring complex and expensive re-engineering of a patient’s own cells. So far, we’ve only seen initial findings in a small group of patients, but the results look promising, and we’re optimistic that this could be a new type of immunotherapy for cancers that are otherwise hard to treat.”

'The least side effects'

Nursing home Estates Manager Richard Condie, 64 from Surrey, was diagnosed with bowel cancer at his local hospital in 2015 and was treated with surgery. However, after being referred to The Royal Marsden for further investigations, scans revealed the disease had spread to his liver. He has since taken part in three clinical trials at the hospital and is currently being treated with AFM24, which has stabilised his cancer and shrunk some of his tumours. Richard said:

“Since 2015, I have been treated with various chemotherapies, an immunotherapy as well as two surgeries which all, for a period of time, worked. However, by January 2021, I was told I had run out of options. About five months later, I was really relieved that, thanks to genetic testing, I was able to join this new trial, which I started in October 2021.

“I receive the drug as an infusion once a week and, out of all the treatments I’ve been given over the past seven years, this one has come with the least side effects. I’m able to work, live an active lifestyle – for instance, I walk my dog, Jet, three miles every morning - and spend time with my wife, three children and four grandchildren, and one more is on the way.

“I think The Royal Marsden is terrific and all the staff, from the cleaners and caterers to the doctors and nurses, are extremely helpful and compassionate.”"

Writing in an editorial published in the BMJ, Dr Victoria Male from the Department of Metabolism, Digestion and Reproduction, has described the results of two new international studies into the impact of COVID-19 vaccines on periods as 'limited but reassuring'.

A deeper understanding of the effects of both infection and vaccination on fertility will enable better counselling of patients for whom this is of particular concern. Dr Viki Male Lecturer in Reproductive Immunology

As vaccines have been rolled out to younger age groups, there has been a growing number of reports of impact on the menstrual cycle, with the UK Medicine and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) receiving more than 36 000 reports of menstrual changes or unexpected vaginal bleeding following a COVID-19 vaccination.

However, as cycles vary naturally, and the MHRA does not collect comparison data from unvaccinated people, it has been difficult to establish whether menstrual changes increase after vaccination.

Two new studies from the US and Norway have helped shed some more light on the potential issue, and although they come with some caveats, the findings from both these studies are reassuring: changes to the menstrual cycle do occur following vaccination, but they are small compared with natural variation and quickly reverse.

The data

The US study of 3959 Americans, found that, in adjusted models, the first dose of vaccine had no effect on the timing of the subsequent period, while the second dose was associated with a delay of 0.45 days. The most affected were the 358 individuals who received both doses of the vaccine in the same cycle, experiencing a 2.32 day delay to their next period.

The second study from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health asked a pre-existing cohort of 5688 Norwegians whether they experienced specific menstrual changes in the cycles before and after each vaccine dose. The study found the most common change associated with vaccination was heavier than normal bleeding. However, the high level of variation in normal cycles is underlined by the finding that 37.8% of participants reported at least one change from normal even in pre-vaccination cycles.

Unlike the US's and Norway's 3-4 weeks intervals between vaccine doses, the UK has at least an 8 week interval between the first and second doses of the vaccine. As such, it is impossible to receive both doses of the vaccine in the same cycle, and this may mean that the changes observed in the US and Norway do not occur here.

A future study using UK participants and the same menstrual cycle tracking app as in the US study will help clarify whether a longer interval between vaccine doses reduces the impact on the menstrual cycle.

Unanswered questions and misinformation

Writing in the BMJ, Dr Male said: ""Taking advantage of pre-existing datasets and cohorts means we have been able to make progress on these questions in a short time, but there is still much to learn.""

Ongoing public concern on the risks and benefits of vaccination, particularly in women and around pregnancy, has arisen from misinformation that COVID vaccines cause female infertility. With evidence that COVID infections can alter periods, better defining the extent and persistence of these changes through further research and studies will be essential in better counselling women on the risks and benefits of vaccination.

Dr Male continues: ""The work that has been done represents a step in the right direction, but the fact that it has taken us so long to get here reflects the low priority with which menstrual and reproductive health is often treated in medical research. The widespread interest in this topic highlights how pressing a concern this is for the public. It’s time we started listening to them.""

The risk is particularly high for pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis in the 7 days after a positive test and risk of PE is significantly elevated up to 56 days after a positive test. Three main factors lead to venous thrombosis: endothelial damage, venous stasis, and a hypercoagulable state. The exact pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the increased risks of thrombosis in COVID-19 are not yet fully explained. Aside from the general risks associated with lowered mobility and potential dehydration in hospitalised patients, infection with SARS-CoV-2 can produce widespread endothelial damage and a marked increase in production of pro-inflammatory cytokines that can induce a hypercoagulable state.

This guideline provides recommendations based on current evidence for best practice in the pharmacological prophylaxis and management of thrombotic complications of COVID-19. It includes advice for non-pregnant adults in hospital in ICU and non-ICU settings, as well as (non-pregnant) patients in the community. It covers all degrees of severity of COVID-19.

COVID-19 is a new disease, and although much information on the infection has been published, there are still areas where evidence is preliminary or lacking and this is highlighted where appropriate.

This guideline does not address risk assessment, diagnosis or investigation of possible thrombotic events, for which existing guidance for patients without COVID-19 should be used.

Background

Women constitute more than half of the UK population (51%) and most of these women at any one time want to either prevent or achieve pregnancy, making contraceptive care crucial for women in their reproductive years. In the UK nearly 45% of pregnancies are unplanned and can have a negative impact on the physical and mental wellbeing of both mother and child. Two groups that are particularly at high risk of unplanned pregnancies are women over 35 years of age and teenagers. Teenage pregnancies are also associated with higher risk of infant death, decreased infant health and poor mental health of the mother.

Access to sexual and reproductive health services

Women may contact sexual and reproductive health services for several reasons, including but not exclusively:

provision of main method of contraception

contraception advice

provision of emergency contraception

removal of contraception devices

sexual health advice

Most women in England access contraception from general practice while younger women and women from marginalised groups tend to access them from sexual and reproductive health clinics. However, one third of women are unable to access contraception from their preferred source, and women who are already disadvantaged are less likely to access contraception services. Women who are not reached by existing contraception services may receive opportunistic contraception advice, such as after taking emergency hormonal contraception (EHC), after having an abortion or a baby, or when they are in contact with health services for other issues.

Types of contraception

Although contraceptive use is high in the UK, the most popular methods are oral contraceptives and male condoms that are user-dependent contraceptives. Long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARC) include intrauterine methods [intrauterine device (IUD)/intrauterine system (IUS)], progestogen subdermal implants and progestogen injectable contraceptives. Long-acting reversible contraceptive is the most effective and cost-effective form of contraception and women should be able to access it through either general practice or sexual and reproductive health services, depending on their personal preference and service availability.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline on long-acting reversible contraceptives concluded that increased long-acting reversible contraceptive uptake would reduce unintended pregnancies and be a cost-effective method. Long-acting reversible contraceptive is more commonly used in older women compared to younger women. Fifty eight percent of women in 2019/20 aged 35-44 years in England were in contact with sexual and reproductive services using a long-acting reversible contraceptive, compared to 42% who were using user dependent contraception.

Impact during COVID-19 pandemic

Contraception provision in community sexual and reproductive health services (excluding general practices and pharmacists) shows a steep fall in access to emergency contraception (53%) and uptake of long-acting reversible contraceptive (43%) during April to September 2020 (see previous link). During the pandemic, some services in the UK, including removal and re-insertion of long-acting reversible contraceptive and drop-in services for young people, either completely ceased or operated with limited capacity and continue to do so. In addition, there has recently been greater awareness and reporting of pain experienced by some women during and post-insertion of an IUD. Issues relating to access and uptake of contraception has the potential to have both medium and long-term effects on women’s choice and uptake of contraception, as well as decisions to discontinue contraception, subsequently leading to implications for not only the individual (unintended pregnancies and abortions, fertility), but also future service and intervention development.

A recently published King's Fund Report reiterated that limited access to contraception could be a potential factor for increased abortion rates among older women aged over 30 years of age. In recent years, rates of abortion have increased amongst women aged 30-34 and peaked during 2019 since the Abortion Act in 1968.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, a drop in the uptake of contraception services by young and ethnic minority people accessing them has been reported. Whilst most women in England can access some form of contraception, deprived and marginalised groups are less likely to be able to access these services, especially when the provision of these services became online. Those without private internet access, for example, find themselves further marginalised as in-person appointments become scarce. The Women’s Health Strategy and the Sexual and Reproductive Health Strategy represent a unique opportunity for the NHS and its partners, including non-governmental organizations or companies under contract to the local government, to tackle long-standing barriers to the delivery of women’s reproductive health. Understanding women’s experiences of access and choice of contraception, along with the impact of sexual and reproductive health services with either joined or fragmented care, are crucial in shaping these strategies.

Long COVID is a new disease with many unanswered questions. This uncertainty creates huge challenges for patients and clinicians.

To date, more than £50 million of government funding has been invested in long COVID research projects. The bulk of this (£39.2 million) has been awarded to 19 projects commissioned through two specific calls. The calls were led by the NIHR, the first jointly with UKRI. Projects examine the underlying mechanisms of long COVID, investigate symptoms such as ‘brain fog’ and breathlessness, and test possible treatments. They explore whether NHS services, such as long COVID clinics, meet people’s needs, and look at what people can do to optimise their own recovery.

This portfolio is complemented by research funded through other routes. These projects consider long COVID in people admitted to hospital, for example, and rehabilitation after infection. The NIHR’s 19 studies are trying to answer some of the most urgent questions.

Most people with COVID-19 experience mild to moderate symptoms they can manage at home. They usually make a full recovery after a couple of weeks. Unfortunately, this is not always the case. In the first NIHR Review, Living with Covid19 (October 2020), one patient described the long COVID ‘nightmare’:

""Early April, two days after testing positive I was hospitalised due to COVID infection with bilateral pneumonia ….I felt as though life was being sucked out every minute and I thought I would die. ….However, I eventually made it back home and I thought recovery would be much easier compared to the nightmare I had already endured except it was the beginning of a different kind of a nightmare – ‘Long Covid’. Although I see this as silent, it is quite debilitating with symptoms of severe fatigue, recurrent sore throats and brain fog. All this has had an immense impact not only on my health but family, social and work life and what makes it even worse is no one knows how long I am likely to take to fully recover.""

Long COVID doesn’t only affect those who feel seriously ill when they first catch the coronavirus. A second testimony, from February 2022, comes from someone who never went to hospital:

“It was as if an elephant was sitting on my chest …I couldn’t breathe, and I was frozen to the core. It was unlike anything I’d ever experienced before.”

This patient went down with COVID-19 the day before the UK was to enter its first coronavirus lockdown, and hasn't had a symptom-free day since, relying on a wheelchair for much of the pandemic. Before falling ill, commuting to work meant a 13 mile cycle ride; these days, 13 metres is a stretch. Long COVID has also had disturbing cognitive effects and left a ‘diabolical’ memory.

Scientific papers weren’t discussing enduring symptoms of COVID at the time that people first started experiencing them. The focus was on acute COVID-19 and people who had been hospitalised with the illness. So people experiencing ongoing symptoms garnered their support from each other using social media platforms. One said, in the first NIHR Review:

“I sobbed when I found a long COVID Facebook group … I then found I wasn’t alone.”

People living with long COVID have acted as sources of intelligence and expertise informing research. They have helped set research priorities, been involved in assessing research applications, and been integral to commissioned research. Testimonies from people living with long COVID informed two narrative NIHR reviews (October 2020 & March 2021) of what was known about long-term COVID symptoms at the time. The reports drew on expert consensus, published evidence, and on the lived experience of people with ongoing effects from COVID-19. This included people who had been admitted to hospital during infection and those who had not.

The scale of chronic ill health and disability after COVID-19 has been described as the next big global health challenge. Persistent COVID-19 symptoms are common. In March 2022, the ONS survey found 1.7m people were experiencing long COVID. As Figure 1 shows, the numbers are rising rapidly.

Figure 1. 1.7 million people were experiencing self-reported long Covid as of 5 March 2022. Estimated number of people living in private households with self-reported long Covid of any duration, UK, four-week periods 2 May 2021 to 5 March 2022.

In the ONS survey, most (67%) of those with self-reported long COVID reported that their symptoms adversely affect their day-to-day activities. That is 1.1 million people in all, and 322,000 (19%) of them reported that their ability to undertake day-to-day activities had been ""limited a lot"". Fatigue was the most common symptom, reported by half (51%) of those with self-reported long COVID. Shortness of breath followed (in 34%), then loss of smell (28%), and muscle ache (24%). As a proportion of the UK population, the prevalence of self-reported long COVID was greatest in people aged 35 to 49 years, females, people living in more deprived areas, those working in social care, teaching and education or health care, and those with another health condition or disability that limits activity.

Many unknowns remain, such as what causes long-term illness and how best to help people. There is still no professional consensus on definition and nomenclature. Without specific diagnostic criteria, clinicians and patients must live with substantial uncertainty. The risk is that people will be either over-investigated and overtreated or not receive adequate support.

The NHS has had to create services for this client group from scratch, while addressing the pandemic and mounting backlog of other work. Around 90 long COVID clinics have been introduced across England. NHS figures from mid-November to mid-December 2021 show that around 5,000 people a month are being referred to these specialist services. Yet the clinics have no proven drug treatments to call upon. Health professionals instead help people to manage their symptoms, and become better able to cope with daily tasks.

Since the start of the pandemic, the NIHR has been funding studies on acute COVID-19, such as those that showed the efficacy of treatments and vaccines. In July 2020, the NIHR funded a £8.4 million research study into the long-term health effects of COVID-19 on hospitalised patients. By then it was becoming clear that some people with COVID-19 experience persistent symptoms even if they are not hospitalised with the illness. It was an obvious next step to undertake research to tackle the longer-term effects of the disease.

The NIHR put out two UK-wide calls for research into the long-term physical and mental health effects of COVID-19 in people who hadn’t been admitted to hospital. The first (run jointly with UKRI) went out in November 2020 and the second in March 2021.

A feature of the NIHR’s research into long COVID is the involvement of patients, carers and members of the public. Patient testimony informed the narrative reviews. People with long COVID and members of the public reviewed proposals put forward by researchers, and sat on the committees that determined which research should be recommended for funding. NIHR is continuing to learn from their experience.

The NIHR’s research portfolio examines the underlying mechanisms of long COVID, investigates symptoms such as ‘brain fog’ and breathlessness, and tests possible treatments. It explores whether NHS services, such as long COVID clinics, meet people’s needs and looks at what people can do to optimise their own recovery.

This portfolio is complemented by studies from other NIHR funding programmes, such as two virtual rehabilitation projects (Rehabilitation Exercise and psycholoGical support After covid-19 InfectioN, £1.2m; Supported remote rehabilitation post Covid-19: development, deployment and evaluation of a digitally enabled rehabilitation programme, £782,000), and a study looking at treating ongoing loss of smell in people who have had COVID (Prevention and treatment of persisting olfactory dysfunction after Covid-19 infection, £34,000)

Why the symptoms of long COVID can persist for months after the initial illness remains a mystery. Before researchers can develop treatments targeted at long COVID, they need to understand its biological causes. The predominant hypotheses are either that people with long COVID never fully clear the virus from their systems; or that the illness results from a dysfunctional immune response, explains Professor David Price, from the School of Medicine, Cardiff University.

Professor Price is planning to investigate whether small fragments of coronavirus persist in the bodies of people with long COVID long after the immune system should have eliminated the virus (Immunologic and virologic determinants of Long Covid, £774,000). At least 200 people with long COVID will be invited for a series of biological tests on their blood, stool, and saliva samples.

“If we get a signal from these tests, we’ll follow it up and see how far it predicts disease severity,” says Professor Price. “Patients are frustrated that there aren’t any answers out there now – or at least none that have been validated. It’s really pressing that we do this as quickly as we can.”

At Imperial College London, Professor Danny Altmann and Professor Rosemary Boyton are also exploring the mechanisms underpinning long COVID (Immune analysis of Long Covid to inform rational choices in diagnostic testing and therapeutics, £574,000). The team are analysing blood samples from people with long COVID who were not hospitalised, and comparing them to people without COVID, and to those who recovered rapidly. The research aims to identify relevant biomarkers which could lead to better diagnostic tests and treatments.

The key to better understanding long COVID is knowing how it manifests in people and why some experience long-term health effects following coronavirus infection and others do not. The REACT study, led by Professor Paul Elliott and Professor Helen Ward at Imperial College London, has tracked England’s epidemic since April 2020. Hundreds of thousands of volunteers are using home testing (swab and antibody tests) each month.

In February 2021, REACT was expanded to investigate long COVID (REACT-LC, £5.4 million) and track any persistent or new symptoms the volunteers experienced. Much published research on long COVID has included only people who were hospitalised or treated at specialist clinics. We now know that even people with mild symptoms can go on to develop long COVID. REACT therefore focuses on people in the community.

In June 2021, the team examined data from half a million adults and found that one in three who reported having COVID, also reported symptoms that lasted 12 weeks or more. This equates to one in 20 adults in England having long COVID at some point. The study showed that women, older people, people who smoke, are overweight or obese, or who live in deprived areas appear to have a higher risk of developing long COVID.

“A population-based study is a really useful resource in terms of exploring the full range of symptoms someone might experience after a positive COVID-19 test,” says Professor Helen Ward, Professor of Public Health at Imperial College London and co-lead of REACT-LC. “Patients have been critical in defining long COVID. We’re partners with the patients in this research process.”

Around 10,000 people who had a positive COVID result during the study had further tests to look for genetic and other possible biological markers for long COVID. Researchers hope to be able to use this data to find clues for possible causes of the illness. This in turn could point to potential treatments, including medications that are already used for other conditions.

The lasting symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection reported by people living with long COVID are manifold. The NIHR review in October 2020 characterised these symptoms. It concluded that, since long COVID affects people in such different ways, it may be four different syndromes.

Researchers at the University of Birmingham are conducting the TLC study (Therapies for Long COVID in non-hospitalised individuals: From symptoms, patient-reported outcomes and immunology to targeted therapies, £2.3 million). This study aims to build a clearer picture of what long COVID is. Its first report, published in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine, sheds light on the ten most commonly reported symptoms. These are: fatigue, shortness of breath, muscle pain, cough, headache, joint pain, chest pain, change in sense of smell and/or taste, and diarrhoea. Other common symptoms include cognitive impairment, memory loss, anxiety and sleep disorders. This review also suggests that people who had five or more symptoms of COVID-19 in the first week of infection are significantly more likely to develop long COVID. Further research by this group has developed a comprehensive tool to assess the symptoms of long COVID and their impact on everyday life.

“This confirms what patients have been saying from the beginning: long COVID doesn't just affect one part of your body,” says TLC co-lead Dr Shamil Haroon. “It affects multiple systems. And has multiple effects.”

Children are unlikely to experience severe acute illness if they contract COVID-19, but unfortunately, some go on to develop long COVID. The CLoCk study (Non-hospitalised Children and young people with Long Covid, £1.9 million) is exploring the prevalence of long COVID in children, and the symptoms most likely to persist weeks after initial infection. It involves collaborators from universities in London, Bristol, Edinburgh and Manchester. It is the world’s largest study of long COVID in children and young people, with 20,000 participants enrolled. Those who have had COVID-19 will be compared to a control group who have never tested positive for the virus.

Researchers will ask participants if they still have physical or mental health problems at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after infection. Participants’ parents and carers will be encouraged to help complete the surveys. The researchers hope the data will help doctors diagnose long COVID in young people, establish how common it is, and how long symptoms might persist.

The CLoCK study was set up in response to conflicting evidence which has suggested that long COVID could affect as few as 1% of children infected with coronavirus; or up to as many as half. Early findings from the CLoCK’s 3-month follow-up suggest that around one in seven (14%) children and young people who catch SARS-CoV-2 have three or more physical symptoms attributable to the virus 15 weeks later.

“The size of our study allowed us to be much more confident that the prevalence wasn’t going to be as big as was feared, but nor was it as trivial as some research suggested,” says Professor Stephenson (who leads the study). “It’s not a figment of people’s imagination. Long COVID really exists and should be taken seriously.”

More targeted treatments for people with long COVID will also come from healthcare professionals knowing what to look for when they diagnose the illness and which factors might make someone more likely to develop it.

Professor Nishi Chaturvedi from UCL leads the CONVALESCENCE study (Characterisation, determinants, mechanisms and consequences of the long-term effects of Covid-19: providing the evidence base for health care services, £9.6 million). This study aims to define long COVID.

Researchers from all over the UK, 130 in all, are analysing the health records of 1.2 million people, together with 10 population-based cohort studies which include more than 45,000 participants. This huge analytical endeavour aims to determine if certain medical conditions increase the risk of developing long COVID. So far, researchers have found that 1.2% of young adults (and 4.8% of people in middle age) report symptoms that limit their daily life following COVID-19 infection. Long COVID appears to be associated with increasing age, female sex and pre-existing conditions such as asthma.

The team will conduct in-depth interviews with at least 80 participants with long COVID to understand their experiences and perspectives. These people are from across the UK and are aged from 20 to 75 years. Some (alongside a control group) will be asked to wear a wristband measuring their exercise ability, breathing and heart rate. They will also undergo non-invasive imaging scans to look for signs of damage to organs such as the heart and lungs.

Ongoing breathlessness after COVID-19 infection can be debilitating. The EXPLAIN project (Hyperpolarised xenon magnetic resonance pulmonary imaging in patients with Long-Covid; £1.9 million) is led by University of Oxford’s Professor Fergus Gleeson. EXPLAIN aims to determine what proportion of patients with long COVID and breathlessness have damaged lungs, and how long it takes them to recover.

Gleeson is using MRI scans to trace inhaled xenon gas moving into and out of the lungs. The 15-minute scan might provide a more accurate measure of lung function than current NHS tests. Early results suggest that xenon MRI scans can identify abnormalities in the lungs of long COVID patients with breathlessness, even when all other tests are normal.

Researchers also want to determine how long COVID might affect the brain. Some studies suggest more than three-quarters of people with the illness report problems with memory, attention and ‘brain fog’. Dr Dennis Chan’s’s CICERO study (Cognitive Impairment in Long Covid: PhEnotyping and RehabilitatiOn, £1.3 million) at UCL is exploring the relationship between brain function and long COVID symptoms, using MRI scanning to identify the brain networks that are affected.

Thanks to research such as the RECOVERY trial, several drugs have now been shown to be effective in the acute stages of COVID-19; they improve the chances that hospitalised patients will survive. But unfortunately, we don’t yet have evidence for medicines to relieve long COVID. The STIMULATE-ICP study (Symptoms, trajectory, inequalities and management: understanding Long Covid to address and transform existing integrated care pathways, £7 million), led by UCL researchers, aims to change this.

The study is recruiting patients who have been referred to NHS long COVID clinical services. It will test the effectiveness of medicines that are used to treat other conditions. Researchers will measure the impact of three months’ treatment on people’s symptoms, their mental health, and ability to return to daily tasks such as going to work. Antihistamines, anti-clotting drugs and anti-inflammatory medicines are being tested, and other drugs may be added to this platform trial. The study will also assess whether MRI scans can help diagnose organ damage. In addition, researchers will test an app which tracks people’s symptoms and provides rehabilitation.

“Long COVID patients have been neglected during the pandemic because the health service has been swamped by the acute needs of people with the virus. Because of that, we haven’t been as quick to acknowledge this new disease,” says chief investigator Professor Amitava Banerjee from UCL. “We would love to improve the treatment of these people.”

Dr Haroon and TLC co-lead Professor Melanie Calvert, also from the University of Birmingham, are also aiming to identify treatments that are likely to help people with long COVID. The TLC study uses a digital platform to assess whether the treatments and supportive interventions reduce symptoms, improve quality of life, and are good value for money.

Vaccines are another approach. They have been shown to reduce the risk of severe acute COVID-19. Anecdotal reports suggest that long COVID patients might experience relief after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine, and a turning point in their illness.

A team at the University of Oxford, led by Professor Daniel Prieto-Alhambra, is using NHS data to determine whether COVID-19 vaccination can protect against developing long COVID (Impact of COVID-19 vaccination on preventing long COVID: a population-based cohort study using linked NHS data, £233,000).

As well as finding medicines for long COVID, we need to know which health services are most useful for people with the illness – and which health professionals are best placed to help them. The LOCOMOTION study (Long Covid multidisciplinary consortium: optimising treatments and services across the NHS, £3.4 million) is led jointly by Dr Manoj Sivan at the University of Leeds and Professor Brendan Delaney at Imperial College London. It aims to develop a ‘gold standard’ approach for treating long COVID in the NHS.

LOCOMOTION is investigating how to ensure patients receive the right support from healthcare professionals, such as GPs and physiotherapists. Researchers will interview healthcare staff, and more than 5,000 patients being treated at 10 NHS sites offering long COVID services. The study will determine which services are most efficient, accessible and cost-effective.

Co-leader Dr Manoj Sivan previously developed the first long COVID diagnostic scale, called C19-YRS. It is now widely used across the NHS for capturing the severity of symptoms that persist for longer than a month after contracting COVID-19.

“Over the last 18 months, various services have emerged for long COVID patients,” says Dr Sivan. “But they’ve all emerged from different sectors of the healthcare system, from GPs to physiotherapists. And there’s quite a lot of variation in the care being offered. We’re trying to bring in some standardisation.”

Standardisation should improve overall standards of care, but there should also be room for some flexibility in a treatment programme. Since long COVID can manifest in different people in different ways, a recovery programme tailored to individual needs might help. The LISTEN project (Long Covid Personalised Self-managemenT support - co-design and EvaluatioN, £1.1 million), led by Professor Fiona Jones from the University of Kingston and Professor Monica Busse of Cardiff University, aims to develop a personalised rehabilitation programme to help people recover from long COVID.

The team are working with people living with, or recovered from, long COVID, including those from under-served populations. Together, they will design a package of tools and tips that people can use to enhance their own recovery. They will also train rehabilitation professionals to focus on listening to the needs of patients. This package is designed to be used along with up to six coaching sessions from rehabilitation practitioners who will deliver personalised therapy. One resource, for instance, describes how to prioritise rest during the recovery journey – and why it’s so important.

“Long COVID is challenging for healthcare professionals because they’re used to having the answers,” says Professor Jones. “This is about the practitioners sitting alongside the patients and going on their journey with them.”

The researchers will then conduct a trial to explore whether the self-management package (including the coaching sessions) helps people with long COVID cope better with their everyday activities. They want to see if it is more effective than the information currently given out to patients by the NHS. If it is, the team will explore how the package might be implemented more widely across the health service.

Researchers are also considering how to ensure that research focuses on the elements of long COVID that are most important to those who have the condition. For example, the CLoCk study has defined long COVID in children. The PC-COS (Post-Covid Condition Core Outcomes, £171,000) has explored the key effects and health outcomes of Long Covid. Both studies involved patients and carers.

To unravel the mysteries of long COVID, and discover the most promising treatments and interventions, research must be wide-ranging. Many urgent questions remain unanswered. Who is most at risk of developing the condition? What is its underlying biology? And which medical treatments and rehabilitation techniques will help patients return to their daily tasks and normal wellbeing?

Undertaking research on a new disease area is always challenging. And understanding long COVID is particularly difficult, because its reported symptoms are highly varied, and don’t fit neatly into current clinical categories. Plus, many people who self-report persistent symptoms were not tested for coronavirus at the time of their initial infection, making it harder to clearly delineate the target patient population. What’s more, the ongoing pandemic continues to disrupt normal working conditions for many researchers.

Considering the illness from multiple angles maximises the chances of finding answers and treatments. Early results from the portfolio are moving us progressively closer to understanding the true prevalence of long COVID and who is most likely to be affected. Ongoing research aims to find out how healthcare services can provide the best care for the many who present with ongoing symptoms following initial COVID-19 infection – and which medications will provide relief.

The NIHR continues to accept research proposals on long COVID through its usual funding calls. The organisation has processes in place to expedite where necessary the decision-making process for priority long COVID proposals. We will also continue to learn from those with long COVID, experts by experience, about how to make the most of this collaborative partnership.

Now, a new study into mental health and nutrient supplementation has taken a leap forward by establishing the gold standard for which nutrients are proven to assist in the management of a range of mental health disorders.



As well as an established relationship between poor diet and mental illness, there is now a vast body of research examining the benefit of nutrient supplementation in people with mental disorders.



To unpack this research, an international team of scientists led by researchers at the University of Manchester and NICM Health Research Institute, Western Sydney University examined the ‘best of the best’ available evidence. The aim was to provide a clear overview of the benefit of specific nutrient supplements - including dosage, target symptoms, safety and tolerability - across different mental disorders.



The world’s largest review of top-tier evidence, published online today in World Psychiatry, examined 33 meta-analyses of randomised control trials (RCTs) and data from 10,951 people with mental health disorders including depression, stress and anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, personality disorders, schizophrenia and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).



Although the majority of nutritional supplements assessed did not significantly improve mental health, the researchers found strong evidence that certain supplements are an effective additional treatment for some mental disorders, supportive of conventional treatment.



All nutrient supplements were found to be safe when recommended dosages and prescriptive instructions were adhered to and there was no evidence of serious adverse effects or contraindications with psychiatric medications.



Summary of results:

The strongest evidence was found for omega-3 supplements (a polyunsaturated fatty acid) as an add-on treatment for major depression – reducing symptoms of depression beyond the effects of antidepressants alone.

There was some evidence to suggest that omega-3 supplements may also have small benefits for ADHD.

There was emerging evidence for the amino acid N-acetylcysteine as a useful adjunctive treatment in mood disorders and schizophrenia.

Special types of folate supplements may be effective as add-on treatments for major depression and schizophrenia, however folic acid was ineffective.

There was no strong evidence for omega-3 for schizophrenia or other mental health conditions.

There is currently a lack of compelling evidence supporting the use of vitamins (such as E, C, or D) and minerals (zinc and magnesium) for any mental disorder.

Lead author of the study, Dr Joseph Firth, Honorary Research Fellow at The University of Manchester and Senior Research Fellow at NICM Health Research Institute, said the findings should be used to produce more evidence-based guidance on the usage of nutrient-based treatments for various mental health conditions.



“While there has been a longstanding interest in the use of nutrient supplements in the treatment of mental illness, the topic is often quite polarising, and surrounded by either over-hyped claims or undue cynicism,” Dr Firth said."

Consumers are more likely to be dissuaded from eating red meat by warning labels relating to its harmful health effects rather than its associated environmental impact, research has shown.

In tests where consumers were given the option of ready meals labelled as harmful to the environment, health, or both, they were more likely to be influenced by health warnings, especially those relating to a specific condition.

The findings suggest that warning labels may aid efforts to deliver the targets of the recently released National Food Strategy in the UK, which suggests nudging consumer habits to deliver a 30 per cent reduction in meat consumption over the next 10 years.

Warning labels alone will not make significant headway, but could support progress as part of a package of measures to nudge consumer action, scientists say.

Consumer attitudes

A team of researchers investigated whether warning labels on food packaging might serve as a strategy to reduce red meat consumption, to deliver the twin benefits of improving health and reducing harm to the environment caused by raising livestock.

Groups of participants in the online study, conducted in the US, were shown beef, chicken and vegetarian varieties of burrito, with the red meat option labelled with a health or environmental warning, both, or neither. People were asked to choose which of the products was most damaging to health and to the environment, and to indicate their preferred product.

Overall, the experiment did not make participants less likely to opt for red meat, but the health warning did make people more likely to identify red meat as damaging to health.

Specific health warnings associated with red meat – relating to colon and rectal cancer – were found to be more discouraging among consumers than a general warning of risk of early death.

The impact of warnings on product selection was stronger among people who ate more meat, the outcomes suggest, which may be valuable in targeting this important demographic.

The findings chime with previous studies showing that people adopt vegetarianism for health reasons rather than meat’s impact on the environment, regardless of their views on climate change.

They also echo earlier findings relating to warnings on tobacco products, where those detailing risk of specific cancers were found to be more impactful than those with a general health warning.

Despite little evidence of shifting consumer behaviour for the environmental impact of meat production, researchers suggest that labelling could raise awareness of this aspect and influence shoppers in future.

The research team was led by the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill and included the Global Academy of Agriculture and Food Security, University of South Carolina Arnold School of Public Health, Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute, and the University of Amsterdam.

The study was funded by Wellcome and published in the International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity.

Our findings give valuable insights into how warning labels are perceived by consumers and could inform efforts to use food labelling as a nudge towards reduced meat consumption, as a package of measures to influence people’s decision making around what they choose to eat.

The NHS pilot, called Heart, is offering genetic tests to 1,000 healthy volunteers aged between 45 and 64 years old to give more accurate predictions for their risk of heart disease and stroke. It was developed by Genomics, the company founded and run by St Anne’s Honorary Fellow, Professor Sir Peter Donnelly.

Of the tests, he said: “These are people going about their daily lives who are at high risk of cardiovascular disease who are currently invisible to the NHS. We can find these people who are actually at quite high levels of risk but not aware of it.”

The pilot could be the first step towards a wider rollout of predictive genetic testing on the NHS to improve screening for those at risk of a range of common diseases including breast and bowel cancer, diabetes and osteoporosis.

Genetics is an important risk factor for many common diseases, including heart disease. However, until recently it has been impossible to quantify the genetic component of risk because it is typically spread thinly over thousands of DNA regions. The advent of vast genetic databases has changed this, allowing scientists to develop algorithms that aggregate the contributions of huge numbers of genes into a “polygenic risk score” (PRS) for a given condition."

Unlike many multicellular organisms, viruses do not leave a true fossil record, meaning that their evolutionary biology over timescales spanning millions of years has, until recently, been poorly understood.

The genomes of multicellular organisms are riddled with fragments of viral infections, known as endogenous viral elements (EVEs), the most common of which are the vertebrate endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). These EVE and ERV sequences can be used to unravel the long-term evolutionary biology of viruses, and also to study the interactions between viruses and their hosts over geological timescales. The spread of EVE sequences within the host genome can also be understood in the context of the highly diverse set of selfish genetic elements that reside within the genomes of their hosts.

Remarkably, some of these EVEs are also functional – exapted sequences, used by the host for its own ends, such as mammalian placentation or antiviral defence. Other EVEs, while largely dormant, can occasionally be re-activated and cause serious disease in their host. In the paleovirology lab, we use EVEs to study the evolutionary biology of viruses, as well as the consequences of EVEs for the biology of their hosts.

Debilitating symptoms may last months, or years. Our team in the Medical Sociology & Health Experiences Research Group (MS&HERG) have been finding out how family life has been transformed by having, or caring for someone with, long Covid. The NIHR funded research (https://www.nihr.ac.uk/) will contribute to a new section on Healthtalk.org, where it will join three other Covid collections. In advance of the main outputs from the study, here we draw attention to how long Covid is affecting family life, schooling, and relationships, with illustrative extracts from our qualitative interviews.

Parental roles have been transformed and dismantled due to long Covid. The responsibility of caring for children and keeping everyone safe could feel scary, as this mother of three young children explained:

“It scared me. I said to my husband, I’ve got three little ones at home and, you know, he’s going to work probably thinking, “Are they safe with her today? Is she going to be all right?” [laughs] Yeah, no, he’s right to but then the anxiety starts kicking in because I think, before I do anything stupid get the kids out the kitchen and I literally, got to a point where I was like, I’m not having the kids in the kitchen. Even when I’m not cooking, even when no oven is on, no nothing is on, nothing is boiling, my anxiety would kick in. I get so anxious, I’d be like, no. And I’d look around thinking, literally, like cooker’s off, hob’s off, oven’s off, kettle’s off, everything is off. Right. And then I’m like, what else could they hurt themselves, what have I not done? I then start looking for things I might have got wrong because it was happening that often.”

Behind these immediate safety concerns there were subtle yet corrosive effects on family relationships and expectations. These were particularly saddening to parents who wondered whether their young children would remember when their parent had been healthy, and whether the changed roles would have a long-term effect on their relationships.

“It’s definitely affected the relationship with me. Before that, I was poorly, I did everything for them. And just little things like if they need somebody in the night, they don’t shout, ‘mummy’ anymore, they shout ‘daddy’. I used to do every school run and everything that they needed, I, I did. And so, they don’t rely on me the same, which is really sad. And they always say, ‘We could do this if mummy wasn’t poorly’. ‘If mummy wasn’t poorly’.

And I was so numb to the fact that I weren’t there with my children and it’s only as I’ve got on some heart medication that’s kind of helped me brain to regain some cognition that I think, ‘Oh my God, where did they even go for the Easter holidays? Who had them.’ Whereas normally, I, I would organise everything like if they went to my mum’s or me sisters. I think I was so out of their lives.

They’ve they did really really well. I’m really proud of ‘em. But surely it will—my little girl is really clinging to me, really really clingy. And my little boy seems to have gone distant. That, that’s my observation of it.”

Quality time as a family unit has been uprooted by the demands of managing long Covid symptoms. Sadly, time for previous priorities has diminished as free time and disposable income has been re-routed to dedicate care to the ill family member. This has left parents grappling with guilt over how this affected their other children and concerns that opportunities to make happy memories are being lost.

For single parents, navigating illness, parenting and employment has become particularly stressful as they attempt to dedicate time to all. We spoke to families where one parent had an extended stay in hospital, or died due to Covid, which was of course devastating for everyone.

These sudden alterations to circumstances have significantly impacted family finances with cutbacks being made to accommodate loss of employment by one or both parents. Annual or unpaid leave has been used to help fulfil caring responsibilities rather than for spending quality time as a family. One mother explained how this left them little time to spend together:

“I guess it’s been tricky because she’s been off school—so any time off, she obviously needs a parent to look after her, so then it... then it impacts on your...on...on my work or my husband’s work; we’ve had to kind of share the time off. So my boss has been pretty flexible, I do not have a job where I can work from home, [chuckles]—so that’s been quite difficult to manage. She’s been very flexible in trying to allow me to work from home at certain times when there’s been tasks that I can do at home. That’s not always an option, so my husband has had to take annual leave in order to look after our daughter, which then, that impacts on us being able to spend time as a family.”

This quote and many similar narratives are a stark reminder of how long Covid has fractured family relationships. For some, disposable income has been re-allocated to private healthcare appointments or seeking overseas clinical trials and treatments, although these are financially inaccessible for most people.

Schooling has become distressing for children and parents who are trying to navigate the periodic and debilitating nature of long Covid, while attempting to engage in structured schooling. For children with brain fog, concentration is very challenging. Lapses in memory and difficulty being in front of the screen have impacted their ability to engage and has made it impossible to keep up with schooling.

Physical symptoms have also disturbed children’s schooling as some have become wheelchair users or have been unable to get out of bed for days after any exertion. For some, adaptations to schedules, classrooms, and the introduction of livestreamed lessons have helped mitigate absences. But we also talked to parents who said they had been threatened with fines due to their child’s non- attendance at school. This became an unwelcome battle for parents who were already worried about their child’s health and the significant interruption to their education.

Long Covid also had detrimental effects on some young adults who had needed to return home from university to be cared for by their parents. Their newly acquired independence and life plans were derailed by long Covid, leaving uncertainty about their future.

Children with long Covid, or whose parents have long Covid, could find their carefree nature was eroded by the reality of their illness. The range of symptoms caused by long Covid have left some with conditions that need close monitoring, causing them to be hyper aware, cautious, and embarrassed by their symptoms. Children and young people who were active before long Covid told us that the prospect of pain, days in bed or even hospitalisation after activity often led to them opting out of social activities and clubs.

Children whose parents had long Covid said there had been major shifts in their relationships, especially when a dramatic decline in the parent’s health required support from their children. One mother said she was reliant on her 8-year-old son for help when she fainted, illustrating the raw reality and responsibility being placed on many children’s shoulders.

“Yeah, so after like the two weeks of having Covid and my husband could go back to work and we weren’t isolating the children were in the house sometimes with just me and I were laid on the settee a lot or in the bed a lot, just while he couldn't like my mum would pick them up from school and then my husband would come home. So, it were just a, a small period between me having some help and that my children were like needing a drink and things like that. So, I had to get up on this occasion and I fainted.

But at that time, my breathing were really, really bad as well and I were really really weak and frail. So, I’d like lost con—I’d fainted and I didn't regain consciousness and I could hear my son talking on the phone but my vision were really blurry. This were when I’d kind of come round and I was still on the floor and I can just remember I were really struggling to breathe and I could hear my dog was outside, barking. This was just my memories of it. I could hear my dog barking outside. I could hear my little boy on the phone, and he was saying, “My mummy is on the floor and she won’t wake up.” And then I’ve got a younger little girl and I can remember she were crying and then the next thing I can remember is my son was on the phone to my mum saying, “You need, you need to come Nana. Mummy’s really poorly.” And my family lived close by and they arrived before the ambulance came and I was still on the floor throughout it all.”

NHS staff across the country have already started vaccinating eligible gay, bisexual or men who have sex with men (GBMSM), along with the frontline staff at greatest risk of exposure and those who have been in close contact with a confirmed case, in line with the UK Health Security Agency advice.

While the vaccine is available across the country and being rolled out in clinics, the expansion in London comes as NHS and UKHSA confirm that London will receive additional doses of the existing supply in an effort to break the chains of transmission as quickly as possible.

Thousands more people who are eligible in the capital will now be contacted over the next few days and weeks about getting their jab, as plans are scaled up and more supply becomes available.

The public is being asked to wait to be contacted with the head of the NHS vaccination programme urging those who are invited to come forward at the earliest possible opportunity.

On Tuesday, UKHSA announced that they had procured more than 100,000 additional vaccine doses with the first 20,000 set to be delivered for use by the NHS in August.

There has been a total of 2,050 confirmed monkeypox cases across England so far with the majority based in London.

In London, there are more than 18 clinics offering vaccinations including Dean Street sexual health clinic in Soho, Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, Guy’s Hospital in Southwark, Mortimer Market Centre in Camden and Barking Hospital Outpatient Centre East. Work to identify, book in and vaccinate patients is underway at every clinic.

Last weekend, clinics in London delivered over 1,000 vaccinations. NHS staff are working hard to offer weekend appointments with as many as 2,000 being offered over Saturdays and Sundays throughout July to maximise convenience.

Steve Russell, NHS Director of Vaccinations, said: “While the risk of monkeypox remains very low and nearly every case we have seen so far has recovered quickly, over 2,000 people have been affected by the virus.

“On the whole, the cases we are seeing are among gay and bisexual men or men who have sex with men, with a significant number coming from London and so it is vital that those who are most likely to get the virus get vaccinated as quickly as possible.

“The NHS is now scaling up its plans to get people vaccinated, particularly in London, thanks to the efforts of staff who are working hard to help stop onward spread, in line with UKHSA advice.

“Thousands more people will be invited very shortly with the number of clinics expanded too, and as we have done with the most successful COVID vaccination programme in history, the NHS will leave no stone unturned in ensuring everyone who is eligible can get protected.

“We will be inviting anyone who we believe is a priority for vaccination and local teams will be working to make sure that anyone who meets the criteria set by UKHSA knows how they can get their jab.

“We are asking people to wait to be contacted and to come forward at the earliest opportunity possible when invited to get vaccinated.”

Over the coming weeks, the number of clinics across the country offering a pre-exposure vaccination will grow rapidly, making it as quick and convenient as possible for people to get a vaccine.

Dr Mary Ramsay, Head of Immunisation at UKHSA, said: “Our surveillance systems were the first in the world to detect the current monkeypox outbreak and specialist public health teams are rapidly following up on all cases to limit transmission.

“Vaccination will further strengthen our response and so we urge all those who are eligible for the vaccine to take it up when offered. It will help protect yourself and others you have had close contact with. While the infection is mild for many, it can cause severe symptoms and hospitalisation in some. Please remember that the vaccine may not provide complete protection against monkeypox, so it is still important to be alert for the symptoms of monkeypox and call 111 or a sexual health clinic if you develop any.

“The NHS will provide the vaccine to those eligible, so please wait until you are offered. Thank you to all our colleagues in sexual health services who are rolling out this important programme”.

Vaccines Minister, Maggie Throup, said: “While we know that monkeypox is usually mild and does not spread easily between people, we have procured more vaccines to further help control the outbreak.

“It is vital people continue to stay alert and contact a sexual health clinic if they notice any unusual rashes or lesions.

“The NHS is already contacting those eligible for the vaccine, and I would urge people to take up the offer as soon as they are contacted. I’m extremely grateful to the fantastic teams working across the capital to keep everyone safe”.

Some sexual health services will contact men who are likely to be at higher risk, for example, those who have had a recent sexually transmitted infection, to come in first. Other services will offer vaccines alongside other appointments, such as HIV PrEP.

The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said: “It’s encouraging that the monkeypox vaccine is being rapidly expanded across our capital.

“With London seeing the highest rate of infection in the country, it is important that NHS London is able to prioritise the vaccination of those most at risk.

“I urge everyone who is offered the vaccine to book their appointment as soon as they are contacted”.

Alex Sparrowhawk, Health Promotion Specialist at Terrence Higgins Trust, said: “The targeted monkeypox vaccination programme is a crucial step forward while the data still shows the virus is disproportionately affecting gay and bisexual men in the UK. As more doses become available, we recommend those offered the vaccine accept it to protect their health and help bring the outbreak under control. We then encourage everyone, regardless of their sexuality, to be vigilant of the symptoms, which can include a rash with new spots, ulcers and blisters”.

Anyone who has symptoms consistent with monkeypox infection should limit interactions with others and contact their local sexual health clinic or phone 111. You should not visit A&E or your GP.

Anyone can get monkeypox and although more people have been diagnosed with it recently, the risk remains low.

Monkeypox can spread from person to person through touching clothing, bedding or towels used by someone with the monkeypox rash, touching monkeypox skin blisters or scabs, or through the coughs or sneezes of a person with the monkeypox rash, including during sex.

Common signs of monkeypox infection include fever, headache, muscle aches, exhaustion, swollen lymph nodes, and the development of a new rash.

Prof Chloe Orkin, Director of the SHARE collaborative for health equity at Queen Mary University of London said: “Globally the picture is highly inequitable and most doctors caring for people with monkeypox infection in the 70 countries affected don’t have access to either vaccines or anti-viral treatments. We are so fortunate that UKHSA has managed to procure 100,000 vaccines to enable NHS England to rapidly expand the vaccination roll-out in London where the highest number of infections are concentrated. This is only possible because of the total commitment of NHS staff at sexual health clinics who have once again risen to the challenge of an escalating global pandemic by working throughout the weekend and offering appointments to people most at risk at the most convenient times.”

Dr John McSorley, Consultant Physician, Sexual Health & HIV Services and BASHH spokesperson “Managing monkeypox is putting a significant burden on services – already facing high demand – given the additional time needed for assessing patients and applying infection control, which in turn is impacting other areas of sexual health care delivery. We welcome the NHS England’s announcement of the accelerated vaccine roll-out and encourage those who are eligible to come forward for vaccination when contacted”."

Seasonal allergy symptoms can be confused with Covid, so what are the defining features of hay fever?
Keep your coolNew evidence suggests that stress could aggravate allergic responses like hay fever.","fever, living, allergy, hay, nose, nasal, covid, ease, pollen, high, sure, help, ways, symptoms, natural","It may be summertime, but for the estimated one in five who suffer from hay fever, the living is far from easy. A tickly, runny nose and itchy, streaming eyes will blight many a sunny day for those afflicted. And now new evidence, published in the esteemed Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal, suggests that climate change may be compounding the misery by triggering larger quantities of pollen over a longer period.

In the UK, the season can now stretch for seven months of the year, beginning with the release of tree pollen in March, peaking in June and July with grass pollen and carrying on until September when weed pollen and fungal spores spread. Antihistamines and steroid nasal sprays are still the go-to remedy for many, but for those looking to add to their allergy-fighting armoury or more natural solutions, we’ve cherry-picked some of the best.



10 natural hay fever remedies

1. Beware ‘pollenution’

Hay fever is a bit of a misnomer as this lurgy is not just a rural problem. Air in towns and cities can sometimes be equally culpable. “Lots of people find their hay fever is worse when there’s high pollution,” explains Jessica Kirby, head of health advice at Asthma UK (asthma.org.uk). “Pollution molecules stick to pollen grains, so they hang about in the air longer and are harder to get out of your airways.”

Traffic smog can trap pollen-filled air near ground level. If you’re a sufferer from the suburbs, try to avoid built-up areas when the pollen count is high. If you can’t, invest in a pair of wraparound sunglasses and apply a little Vaseline around your nostrils: both can block the pollen from getting into your system.

2. Make home a pollen-free zone

Don’t invite the enemy in. If you’ve been exposed to pollen, change your clothes, shower and wash your hair as soon as you get home. Experts also recommend keeping windows closed on high pollen-count days, and dusting and vacuuming regularly, using a model preferably with a HEPA filter. Avoid drying clothes outside as they can pick up pollen and – however pretty those blowsy summer blooms – don’t bring flowers into the house. Also bear in mind that pets can be pollen carriers, so give them regular baths when the count is high.

3. Follow your gut instinct

We’re increasingly aware of the role that ‘good bacteria’ plays within our immune system, and now a US study suggests that probiotics may have the potential to ease hay fever symptoms of an itchy, blocked or runny nose. Try boosting your probiotic intake with ‘live’ sauerkraut and kimchi rather than yogurt, as dairy foods can increase the production of mucus. Miso soup is also full of probiotics and, when prepared as a hot drink, can help to soothe an aggravated throat and stuffy nose.

Hay fever or Covid-19?

Seasonal allergy symptoms can be confused with Covid, so what are the defining features of hay fever? We asked Holly Shaw, clinical nurse advisor at Allergy UK…

It does not cause a fever – despite the name. Conversely, a high temperature is one of the main symptoms of Covid-19.

Symptoms commonly affect the nasal passages, such as a runny or blocked nose and sneezing. These are not listed as main symptoms of Covid-19 by the NHS.

Hay fever will not trigger a change to your taste and smell.

It tends to affect sufferers on a seasonal basis, at a similar time each year.

Symptoms are usually alleviated by antihistamine medication.

Note that both hay fever and Covid-19 can cause a cough.

4. Keep your cool

New evidence suggests that stress could aggravate allergic responses like hay fever. A recent report published in the Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology found that allergy sufferers with the most flare-ups also had higher stress levels. Of course, this can be a vicious circle.

“Persistent and problematic symptoms can be stressful, especially if these symptoms impact daily living, schooling and work,” says Holly Shaw, clinical nurse advisor at Allergy UK. To break out of the stress/symptom cycle, try yoga (Yoga with Adriene has millions of followers and her free online classes are suitable for all). Studies show it may help to reduce stress levels, plus it’s easy to do indoors, so, unlike walking or running , you won’t need to fit it in around high pollen counts.

5. Go easy on your nose

Avoid the temptation to reach for a hanky every 20 seconds. “If your nose is running or congested, you may feel the need to blow it, but do this as gently as possible, as the nasal passages can become inflamed and sensitive,” Holly explains. “Saline nasal sprays and irrigation can help soothe inflammation and clear the nasal passage of any impurities and allergens.”

A steamy cup of herbal tea can also help to relieve a blocked nose: the menthol in peppermint may help to improve nasal air flow, while ginger is soothing for a sore throat.

6. Snap up the app

Forewarned is forearmed: a number of apps can give you the heads-up about when you might be better staying indoors. The Met Office produces a daily pollen forecast from March to September, with opt-in notifications. Pollen.com provides a forecast for specific types of allergy, from trees to flowers. Keep an eye on the weather forecast, too, with the BBC Weather app.

Pollen counts peak on warm summer days with low humidity and a gentle breeze. Pollen levels are lower after it’s rained, but tread carefully around thunderstorms. “They can cause your symptoms to flare up, because they smash pollen into tiny bits that

go deeper into your lungs,” Jessica Kirby says.

7. Plant smart

There are plenty of ways to tweak your garden to reduce the number of potential allergens. If you’re allergic to tree pollen, avoid wind-pollinated trees (such as ash, birch, horse chestnut or plane). Instead, look to insect-pollinated plants such as fruit trees, which produce heavier pollen that’s not so easily blown around.

The same goes for flowers: the pollinator-friendly types are likely to be better, particularly those that encase the pollen with a bloom, such as foxglovesc. Those allergic to grass pollen may want to avoid ornamental grasses. You can also reduce risks by avoiding your garden in the early morning and evening, when pollen is likely to be at its highest.

“I’m allergic to my job!”

“I’m one of those people with a long list of allergens – pollen, hay, horses, rabbits… When I was a child, I wanted to ride but I had to wear a beanie (to contain my dust-trapping long hair) and sunglasses, all year round. When my mother finally insisted it wasn’t the hobby for me, my streaming eyes weren’t just down to the allergy. Ironically, I landed a dream job that involves visiting farms, gardens, woods and, yes, even stables. Last spring, I went to an equine therapy centre in Gloucestershire. Ponies plus hay plus pollen equalled potential disaster. I had to ‘social distance’ from the animals and, as always, I had my allergy first aid kit to hand – tissues, hair bands, sunglasses, antihistamines, inhaler (I also have asthma), lip balm (not being able to breathe through my nose makes my lips dry) and hand sanitiser. This kit is my lifesaver. I always take it when I’m filming in the countryside. It allows me to do a job I love without pesky allergies taking me down.”

If it sounds a bit crazy, it probably is, and vaginal steaming (sometimes called yoni or V-steaming) has had a big question mark hovering over its head ever since it waltzed into the discourse around our intimate health in 2010. Gwyneth has a lot to answer for - along with the jade eggs, she has endorsed steaming the vagina on Goop, and utilising different herbs (rosemary, basil and wormwood are among the unlucky few) as part of the act; claims that a simple steam can do everything from boost fertility to reduce menstrual symptoms and even ease stress are not scientifically proven and yet, somehow, it still remains a trend.

The celebs are famous fans of vaginal steaming. Sound odd? It kinda is. If you're a little confused, think of it this way: It’s essentially a facial for your vulva.

Vagina steaming has gotten the Goop treatment in the past, putting it in the spotlight. And Chrissy Teigen posted a photo on Instagram that showed her squatting over some kind of contraption with a blanket draped over her knees. (She was also clutching a heating pad over her neck while wearing a face mask, FWIW.)

“Face mask / heat pad / vagina steam no I don’t know if any of this works but it can’t hurt right? *vagina dissolves*,” she wrote.

Oh, but Chrissy—it definitely can hurt. Spoiler alert: Your vagina isn't a set of curtains that needs to be steam cleaned from time to time.

What is vagina steaming?

Yoni steaming entails sitting sans underwear on a chair with a hole in the middle, over a bowl containing steaming hot water infused with a blend of herbs, which are often mugwort (Gwyneth’s go-to), chamomile, basil, oregano and wormwood, to name a few. (Those wishing to work their quads can also simply squat over the bowl.) A session typically lasts around 20 minutes, but can last up to an hour, and the purported perks include everything from easing menstrual symptoms, stress, digestive issues, depression, hemorrhoids, headaches, fatigue, and pain to boosting fertility and healing post childbirth.

Sound too good to be true? That’s because it is. Between childbirth, your period, and sex, it’s quite an understatement to say your vagina goes through a lot, but that doesn’t mean a special spa day for it is the solution. Whether you try it at home or at a spa, the reality is that v-steaming has absolutely no scientific basis. Since your skin down there is super sensitive and delicate, it doesn’t take much to accidentally burn it. Plus, overheating your vagina could create an environment for bacteria to thrive in—hello, yeast infection. It’s even more important to avoid v-steaming during pregnancy, since some herbs may cause miscarriage.

Then there's the whole thing about how the vagina literally cleans itself. A healthy vagina has bacteria that helps keep the vaginal pH at the right level, but disrupting this environment (through steaming, douching, etc.) can actually increase the risk of infection, according to women’s health expert Jennifer Wider, M.D.

So, I definitely shouldn't try to steam my vagina, right?

Yeah, that's a hard no. “Although this steaming has been used all over the world it makes no sense,” says Lynette J. Margesson, MD, FRCPC, Assistant Professor of Dermatology and Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth College. “Why would one do this? The steam almost never gets inside the vagina. Steaming would just affect the vulva and potentially scald the skin. Unfortunately, women mix up the vulva and vagina all the time. They, too frequently, are taught that the genital area is a taboo, dirty area—how sad!”

If you’re having cramps, Jessica Shepherd, M.D., a minimally invasive gynecologist at Baylor University Medical Center at Dallas, recommends taking an NSAID to help with the pain. A heating pad and exercise can also help, Wider says. If it doesn’t, and your cramps are beyond terrible (or you're having them outside of your period), talk to your doctor. This could be a sign that you’re struggling with an underlying condition like endometriosis or adenomyosis, both of which need medical attention, says Shepherd.

And since you won't be steam cleaning your nether parts, instead Dr. Margesson recommends keeping it simple and washing your vagina with hands only (no face cloths, scrubbers or antiseptics) using mild hypoallergenic cleansers, then patting the area dry. “Care for the genital area should always be gentle care,” she says. Bottom line: Save the facials for your face."

164818,https://graziadaily.co.uk/beauty-hair/wellness/women-medical-health/,,True,Are You At Risk From The Gender Health Gap?,"Nicki, now 29 and a brand and business coach, believes she was a victim of the gender health gap, in which women’s ailments are routinely dismissed or diminished by the medical establishment.
It follows other recent research by the BHF, which found a ‘heart attack gender gap’ caused more than 8,200 women in England and Wales to die needlessly over a 10-year period.
‘The health gender gap is fed by perceptions of women as being over- emotional and exaggerating the extent of their pain and suffering,’ says women’s health specialist Dr Larisa Corda.
Yet study after study has shown that female pain is given less credence than male pain.
Women’s symptoms often differ from men’s, even for the same conditions, as in the case of heart disease.","told, female, women, pain, heart, gap, symptoms, men, health, gender, likely, womens, risk","Nicki James was 19 when she began suffering from exhaustion so severe she could barely function. She went up four dress sizes, her hair grew brittle and her eyebrows fell out. For two years, she made trip after trip to her GP, who insisted that her problems were mental and prescribed antidepressants.

‘I knew I wasn’t depressed,’ says Nicki. ‘I was ill, but I wasn’t being listened to.’ After two years, in despair, she saw another doctor who ordered tests that revealed she was suffering from an underactive thyroid. ‘It took a long time to stabilise my condition because it had been left to run for so long, while I was gaslighted into thinking it was all in my head.

Nicki, now 29 and a brand and business coach, believes she was a victim of the gender health gap, in which women’s ailments are routinely dismissed or diminished by the medical establishment. As a growing body of research shows, this discrimination is causing years of delays in accessing treatment, needless pain and suffering and even preventable deaths.

Earlier this month, a study funded by the British Heart Foundation revealed that women who suffer heart attacks are half as likely as men to receive the recommended medical treatment – for instance, only 15% of female patients were fitted with a stent compared to 34% of men. It follows other recent research by the BHF, which found a ‘heart attack gender gap’ caused more than 8,200 women in England and Wales to die needlessly over a 10-year period.

Now it appears this inequality is even built into the widely used GP app Babylon, which uses an algorithm to identify health issues. Shockingly, earlier this month it was found that while a 60-year-old male smoker reporting sudden chest pain and nausea is advised to go to A&E as he may be suffering a heart attack, a woman with the same profile and symptoms is told she is likely having a panic attack. (Babylon says its chatbot is not a diagnostic tool and provides answers on ‘the basis of probability’. It said women’s risk of coronary heart disease ‘is well known to be different from men’ and ‘studies show women are almost twice as likely as men to suffer from anxiety disorders’. It said the chatbot had been used 1.5m times ‘with no reports of a serious problem’ raised by a patient.

It’s not only in heart disease – which kills twice as many women as breast cancer, and more women than men – that our care falls short. In fields as diverse as brain cancer, chronic pain, endometriosis and dementia, women are o en misdiagnosed and under- treated. In Britain today, 55% of registered medical practitioners are male, as are 66% of specialists. Although there’s no suggestion that doctors of either gender deliberately minimise female patients’ concerns, there appears to be ingrained unconscious bias at play.

‘The health gender gap is fed by perceptions of women as being over- emotional and exaggerating the extent of their pain and suffering,’ says women’s health specialist Dr Larisa Corda. ‘In reality, many women under-report symptoms, because they’re busy and they don’t want to make a fuss. If they’re not taken seriously when they do see a doctor, it propagates the notion that whatever they’re going through isn’t serious, which can have massive implications.

Women’s stoicism when experiencing pain is a scientifically proven fact, and unsurprising considering our bodies are built to withstand childbirth. Yet study after study has shown that female pain is given less credence than male pain. When men and women have the same symptoms, women are more likely to be told their pain is psychosomatic – patronisingly dismissed as ‘anxious’ rather than unwell – and prescribed sedatives instead of painkillers.

In A&E, when men and women present with abdominal pain of the same severity, men wait an average of 49 minutes before being treated, while the average wait for women is 65 minutes. Doctors and nurses also prescribe less pain medication to women than men post-surgery.

‘It’s a hangover from the Victorian era, when women’s illnesses were said to be the result of “hysteria” and women were institutionalised rather than treated,’ says Monica Karpinski, founder of women’s health platform The Femedic. ‘Women are being told their very real symptoms are all in their head, which is incredibly damaging.’

Journalist and author Julia Buckley can attest to this. Her chronic pain first started during primary school, but was frequently dismissed by doctors. At 30, when the pain in her legs became too much to cope with, one medic told her it was simply ‘part of the ageing process’. Eventually, she was diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, an inherited condition that affects connective tissue, but her battle to be taken seriously continued. ‘I had an accident at work that crushed a nerve in my neck, but I was told by so many doctors that it wasn’t an injury, just part of my EDS,’ she says. ‘I was told I’d be in pain for the rest of my life, that I’d never work again, and essentially patted on the head and sent home.

On one occasion, when Julia asked for physiotherapy on her arm, she was told to wait a year, because she had already had physiotherapy on her lower back. ‘I don’t think that if I’d been a man saying I needed to get back to work, my issues would have been swept under the carpet in the same way,’ says Julia, whose book about her experiences, Heal Me: In Search Of A Cure, was published last year.

‘So often, I felt patronised and belittled by the doctors I saw. I even started dropping scientific terms into our conversations to try to get them to listen to me. Sometimes, I’d be so frustrated I’d cry, which meant I was dismissed even more quickly. Spending years being told I was wrong about everything was so undermining – it really affected my confidence and trust in myself. Women are spending their lives in pain and not being given the chance to get better, which makes me really angry.’

Lack of accurate diagnosis is particularly common when it comes to gynaecological issues such as endometriosis, an often highly debilitating condition that affects one in 10 women but takes an average of seven to 10 years to be diagnosed.‘Too often, symptoms are dismissed as ordinary period pain and not investigated, and the mental health implications of that can be horrific,’ says Dr Corda. ‘Last year, over 100 women took their own lives because of endometriosis.

For black, Asian and minority ethnic women the picture is even bleaker. A 2010 study by the National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit reviewing the experiences of over 24,000 women receiving maternity care in Britain found that black African women were least likely to receive pain relief in labour. They are also more than four times more likely to die during or soon after pregnancy than Caucasian women.

The sense that the traditional medical establishment is not listening to women may be contributing to the boom in alternative and complementary therapies, which women are more likely to seek than men. Nutritionist Sana Khan says she often sees women who are desperate for help. ‘I have to write to doctors requesting that they test my female clients’ thyroid function, because they haven’t investigated their symptoms, or clients have been told they have IBS when it’s actually a parasitic infection,’ she says.

‘I understand the NHS is under a great deal of pressure and funding is an issue, but often my clients feel their voices haven’t been heard at all, so they end up spending a fortune trying to get answers elsewhere.’

As feminist campaigner Caroline Criado Perez points out in her book, Invisible Women, compounding the unconscious sexism feeding the gender health gap is the fact the medical community knows far less about the female body than the male. Until recently, female humans, animals and cells were largely excluded from clinical research, with males taken to represent humanity as a whole. She describes this approach as ‘treating women’s bodies as strange, unknowable deviations from a male norm’

The perception is that women exaggerate the extent of their pain. In reality, many under-report symptom

Women’s hormonal fluctuations, which can disrupt test results, are often cited as the reason for our exclusion. In the real world, however, women are being given these drugs – and the impact of these fluctuations on their efficacy and safety aren’t known until then. Likewise, little research has been done into the impact of women’s menstrual cycles on their susceptibility to pain, and whether different medications would work better for female bodies.

Women’s symptoms often differ from men’s, even for the same conditions, as in the case of heart disease. While both suffer chest pain, women are also likely to have ‘silent’ symptoms, such as a shortness of breath, fatigue, nausea, dizziness or pain in unlikely places, such as the jaw.

Dr Sanne Peters, a research fellow in epidemiology at Oxford University’s George Institute, is currently researching inconsistencies between male and female access to treatment for heart conditions. ‘We’ve only really started to look at these gender differences over the past decade,’ she says. ‘So there’s a problem in terms of awareness that they’re an issue, and also in terms of our knowledge of what’s causing them – whether they’re down to biological factors that put women at a higher risk, or gaps in treatment caused by bias.’

In other words, we’re only at the start of the process of gathering the data needed for the situation to change on a systemic level. Femtech, a fast-growing sector including period tracker apps, is playing a part in collecting female-centric data, which is beginning to increase the healthcare industry’s understanding of women’s illnesses.

To change the unconscious biases often at work when we visit our GP or walk into an appointment with a specialist, more effort and awareness is needed at training level. ‘Medical misogyny is more widely known about than ever before, but tackling it needs to be a priority from the start of doctors’ careers,’ says Julia. ‘It starts with listening to women, not assuming they’re hysterical.’

Dr Corda agrees. ‘Quite simply, women deserve to be taken seriously from the beginning,’ she says."

NHS Scotland Gender Reassignment Protocol

The Gender Reassignment Protocol was issued to NHS health boards on 11 July 2012.

The Gender Reassignment Protocol contains many therapies and surgical procedures. The patient and their gender clinician should discuss these in detail. This helps to find the most appropriate treatment pathway.

The Equality Act 2010

The Equality Act, 2010 protects transgender people from discrimination and harassment. It provides protection in different areas, including in the workplace or in the provision of goods and services.

A person does not need to be under medical supervision to be protected by the Act. For example, someone assigned male at birth who decides to live as a woman, but does not consult a doctor or undergo any medical procedures, would be protected.

The Act also protects people associated with them. This includes family members, as well as others who are perceived to be transgender.

Gender Recognition Act 2004

Under the Gender Recognition Act of 2004, transgender people can:

apply for and obtain a Gender Recognition Certificate to legally change their gender

get an updated birth certificate

marry or form a civil partnership in their gender

have their gender recorded on their death certificate

To apply for a Gender Recognition Certificate you must be aged 18 or over. The application process requires you to prove that you:

have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria

have lived in your gender for the last 2 years

intend to live permanently in this gender

NHS England has a legal duty to see 92% of trans people referred for specialist treatment within 18 weeks. The average waiting time for young people to get treatment is three years, while for many adults it’s four years or more. Waiting lists stretch into the thousands, and this situation predated the pandemic by a long margin.

That’s why we’ve brought a legal challenge against NHS England.

In November 2022, the High Court heard our claim – brought alongside five co-claimants: Eva and Alex, two children and trans-led grassroots charity Gendered Intelligence. We say these waiting times, and other failures in trans healthcare services, are discriminatory and unlawful.

Such long waits mean trans adolescents are missing the short window of time in which puberty blockers are useful. While adults don’t face the same issue, the denial of treatment restricts the lives they are able to lead and has hugely harmful consequences for mental health.

The bottom line is waits for treatment are leading to the loss of lives and things are getting worse, not better. This cannot continue unchecked.

When New Family Social organised its first national campaign to encourage more people from our community to consider adoption or fostering, it was a direct response to the environment of the time. While same-gender couples could legally adopt, there was little knowledge or expertise in agencies on how to tap into the desire of LGBTQ+ people to explore these routes to building their family.

Since the first year, we've worked hard to bring together agencies from across the UK to do just that, by bringing them together with LGBTQ+ potential applicants. As an independent, peer-support charity LGBTQ+ people know and expect us to tell the truth about what their experience of adoption and fostering is likely to be - both as parents and carers and as applicants going through the assessment process.

This credibility is hard-earned. As adoptive parents and foster carers we've seen the positive change brought by our choices to adopt or foster. We know - and tell our members - when the potential barriers are and how to navigate the flaws in the system.

We're thrilled that in Wales all of the adoption collaboratives supported LGBTQ+ Adoption & Fostering Week 2024. In 2022, 1 in 4 adoptions in the country were to same-gender couples. In England - bar a couple of exceptions - all regional adoption agencies and voluntary agencies took part too. In 2023, 1 in 5 adoptions in England were to same-gender couples. In Northern Ireland it stood at 1 in 8.

In Scotland it's a different story. There's little participation by local authorities in the campaign. With just 1 in 12 adoptions in 2022 in Scotland being to same-gender couples, it's the poorest representation of LGBTQ+ people in adoption in the UK. And that was a fall in the proportion from the previous year of 1 in 11.

It's unsurprising - and hugely heartening - that the voluntary agencies in Scotland that do take part in the campaign report that up to 50 per cent of the applicants they assess are LGBTQ+. Where our community finds a service that wants to welcome them they'll head to it in numbers. We're truly grateful for all the work those agencies do to encourage and support LGBTQ+ people - and to the hundreds of agencies in England, Wales and Northern Ireland that similarly recognised the importance of engaging LGBTQ+ potential applicants and took part in the campaign.

162439,https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/332828/,Petitions to lower the age that breast screening services are offered.,True,Lower the age that breast screening services are offered,"The NHS Breast Screening Programme (NHS BSP) in England offers all women aged between 50 and their 71st birthday the opportunity to be screened every three years for breast cancer, in order to detect abnormalities.
Breast screening is offered from age 50 because the chance of developing breast cancer increases with age: four out of five breast cancers develop in women over 50.
There is little evidence to show that regular mammograms for women below the current screening age would result in reduced deaths from breast cancer.
You can read more about the trial here: https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/find-a-clinical-trial/a-study-to-evaluate-an-age-extension-of-the-nhs-breast-screening-programmeThere is substantial international evidence on the effectiveness of breast screening.
The findings support the current age at which women are first invited for breast screening in England and the three-year interval period between invitations.","services, women, early, cancer, programme, screening, review, uk, age, nhs, lower, breast, offered","Breast cancer can be a devastating disease, affecting people of all ages and genders.

The Government recognises your concerns and is committed to the early detection and treatment of breast cancer as part of our commitment to detect 75% of cancers at stage 1 or 2, and for 55,000 more people to survive cancer for five years in England each year from 2028, as detailed in the NHS Long Term Plan.

As you rightly identify, population screening programmes are crucial to detecting cancer as early as possible and therefore increasing the likelihood of survival through early treatment. The NHS Breast Screening Programme (NHS BSP) in England offers all women aged between 50 and their 71st birthday the opportunity to be screened every three years for breast cancer, in order to detect abnormalities.

Breast screening is offered from age 50 because the chance of developing breast cancer increases with age: four out of five breast cancers develop in women over 50. The 2012 UK independent review of breast cancer screening (the Marmot review) estimated that inviting women aged 50-70 reduces mortality from breast cancer in the population invited by 20% and saves an estimated 1,300 lives a year. You can read the review here: http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/prod_consump/groups/cr_common/@nre/@pol/documents/generalcontent/breast-screening-report.pdf

The UK National Screening Committee (UK NSC) advises the Government and the NHS on all aspects of screening. The UK NSC will only recommend a screening programme when it can be demonstrated that the benefits of the programme clearly outweigh any harm they may cause, for example from false positives or overtreatment. You can find the criteria here: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/evidence-review-criteria-national-screening-programmes/criteria-for-appraising-the-viability-effectiveness-and-appropriateness-of-a-screening-programme.

There is little evidence to show that regular mammograms for women below the current screening age would result in reduced deaths from breast cancer. The Marmot review found that screening women outside the ages of 50-70 years could lead to over-diagnosis (referring women for unnecessary tests) and over-treatment (operating on women with disease which is unlikely to cause serious harm to them). Not all breast cancers can be detected early when they are non-invasive, and some women with non-invasive disease would never develop cancer during their lifetime. Abnormalities that would never have developed into a cancer would be found and treated, potentially causing unnecessary harm and anxiety.

The UK NSC recognises that screening programmes are not static and over time may need to change to be more effective. They are constantly assessing the latest evidence and change their advice accordingly. Changes to a programme can be submitted to the Committee for consideration throughout the year: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-nsc-evidence-review-process/uk-nsc-evidence-review-process

There is a great deal of research currently being undertaken to better understand the early onset of cancer and the extension of screening to ages beyond the scope of the current programme. There are several trials in the NHS BSP that are seeking to understand the early development of conditions that can lead to breast cancer (https://www.gov.uk/guidance/breast-screening-the-sloane-project; www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/find-a-clinical-trial/a-trial-comparing-surgery-with-active-monitoring-for-low-risk-dcis-loris). There is also a trial currently underway that is investigating whether extending screening to those aged 47-49 and 71-73 would be effective. It is the biggest trial of its kind ever to be undertaken and will provide robust evidence about the effectiveness of screening in these age groups, including the benefit and harms. The UK NSC will review the publication of the age extension trial when it reports in 2026. You can read more about the trial here: https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/find-a-clinical-trial/a-study-to-evaluate-an-age-extension-of-the-nhs-breast-screening-programme

There is substantial international evidence on the effectiveness of breast screening. A group of 29 independent international experts from 16 countries, convened by the World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), assessed the cancer-preventive and adverse effects of various methods of screening for breast cancer in 2015. The findings support the current age at which women are first invited for breast screening in England and the three-year interval period between invitations.

Do you have energy limiting condition (ELC)?

Are you dealing with health condition(s) that cause symptoms such as physical fatigue, mental fatigue and pain, which significantly restrict your day-to-day activities?

People with ELCs have a range of medical diagnoses, and our symptoms may vary and fluctuate, but the overall impact on our lives is of energy impairment. We have to carefully ration our energy every day in order to avoid aggravating our symptoms. Read more about energy impairment.



Examples of ELCs include: ME/CFS (myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome), fibromyalgia, lupus, chronic pain, Ehlers Danlos syndrome, Long Covid, as well as conditions causing: respiratory failure, kidney failure, inflammatory bowel conditions, sickle cell disease, autoimmune conditions, neurological conditions, endocrinological conditions, and rheumatological conditions.

If this is you, you are part of an invisible community

Government research tells us that problems with ‘stamina, breathing or fatigue’ are the second most common form of impairment or disability in the UK. But we are invisible – often confined to our homes or beds, neglected by the medical profession and unable to participate in ordinary life.

According to our research, people with energy limiting conditions experience high levels of social isolation, stigma and lack of representation.

People with ELCs have rights as disabled people, but many of us are not aware of this. And we are certainly not getting access to those rights.

People with ELCs have much in common

While our individual medical diagnoses vary, as a group of disabled people we have many things in common:

Often dismissed or told our conditions are ‘all in our heads’ when we go for medical help.

Many of us go years – even decades – without proper diagnosis or treatment.

FAQ page . Often bedbound or housebound and extremely isolated. Read our

People around us do not believe in our conditions, how they affect us, or our needs.

Difficulty accessing benefits and other Government support.

Employers, councils, venues and businesses are unwilling to make adjustments that would allow us to participate more in society, such as home or flexible working, and public rest spaces.

Our conditions are often under-researched due to lack of funding or interest from the medical community.

We feel invisible, voiceless, even hopeless.

It’s time our voices were heard

We need to be seen, believed, and heard: by doctors, by politicians, by the media and by society as a whole. That’s why we started Chronic Illness Inclusion (CII).

That our British farmers are bound by ever increasing controls, including the inevitable live export ban, but then allowing global producers the freedom to live export huge quantities of animals reared in feedlots, infused with hormones and antibiotics, that consume feed grown using pesticides banned here, is an absolute betrayal to every single British person.

The teenager had been struggling with gender dysphoria for years and by the time she turned 16, she had reached breaking point and decided to come out to her mother. With her mum’s support, Mai felt ready to seek gender-affirming care, beginning with Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT). But the system she was about to navigate was not prepared for her, or thousands of other transgender and non-binary people, desperate for healthcare tailored to them.

Mai was met with long waiting lists, a lack of clear information, and medics who did not seem trained to deal with issues relating to transgender healthcare. “The first thing that I did was to go to my GP,” Mai remembers. “When I spoke to my GP, they weren’t sure what to do. I could see that there was a clear lack of training regarding this medical matter.”

By the time Mai had her first appointment at the Tavistock and Portman Gender Identity Clinic in London, she was 20. It took another year and half for her to finally begin Hormone Replacement Therapy, as she had to attend diagnostic sessions with clinicians, with several months of waiting in between, before she could start receiving hormones. “[It was] difficult for me to wait those three years [for my first appointment], because at that time it was very much a struggle, you know, feeling gender dysphoria and not feeling happy with my body,” Mai adds.

During her years-long wait to begin treatment, Mai had zero professional mental health support in between appointments. She began to self-isolate from society and fell into a deep depression, feeling lost without professional guidance to turn to. “I feel that there’s less care for trans lives,” Mai tells gal-dem. “The medical field does not give a fuck about this situation. I don’t think they see trans lives as lives that are worth saving”.

A crisis in care

Mai’s story is sadly not an outlier. Trans healthcare in the UK – from gender- affirming treatments to general care – is in crisis. A climate of transphobia, a stretched NHS and an archaic infrastructre that pathologises inflexible pathways are all contributing to an increasingly desperate situation for trans and non-binary people seeking the treatment they’re entitled to.

Author Shon Faye writes in The Transgender Issue that, “large parts of the [trans-related healthcare] system remain unreformed, anachronistic and unfit for purpose” in the UK. Whilst the UK’s trans-related healthcare system remains centred around a handful of regional Gender Identity Clinics, many other countries, such as the US and Canada, have progressed to more flexible forms of care where “multiple health centres could initiate hormone treatment more quickly on the basis of the patient’s informed consent, without any need for a formal process of diagnosis,” she notes. As Faye points out, the fight for healthcare investment is one that benefits all. The current system, however, is working for no one – and for trans people of colour, who are subject to additional barriers to accessing healthcare, the outlook is even bleaker.

A recent survey by TransActual, a trans-led campaigning organisation, found that trans people of colour are twice as likely as their white counterparts to experience transphobia when accessing trans-specific healthcare. More than half of transgender people of colour experience racism when accessing both trans-specific and general healthcare in the UK. Further reports of medical racism in healthcare settings see transgender people of colour hesistate to in seeking help in the first place. And without swift action, the problem looks to increase.

When it comes to gender-affirming care – an umbrella term that refers to treatment transgender and non-binary individuals seek to help affirm their gender identity – access has become a bottleneck. Whilst not all trans and non-binary people seek to transition medically, for those that do, the wait can feel torturous.

“We’re not forgotten about, they know we’re on the waiting lists – we’re ignored” Eva Echo

In England there are seven NHS Gender Identity Clinics for adults, and only one for under 18s. In the devolved nations, Wales is served by a single Gender Service with a base located in Cardiff, Scotland has four physical GICs and Northern Ireland, two. NHS patients are usually entitled to treatment within 18 weeks of a referral, however transgender and non-binary patients seeking gender-affirming care often have to wait years for their first appointment with a Gender Identity Clinic. The Tavistock and Portman Clinic in London recently made their current waiting list public; prospective patients face a four-year gap between referral and treatment and nearly 10,000 people are in line for care.

“We’re not forgotten about, they know we’re on the waiting lists – we’re ignored,” says Eva Echo, a transgender activist based in Birmingham. She’s one of the thousands of people still waiting for their first appointment with a GIC, and has been since 2017. Her clinic no longer accepts new patient referrals. “We’re in limbo,” says Eva. “We were left to fend for ourselves.”

Whilst in the queue for gender-affirmative care, Eva has tried to seek mental health support from the NHS. Instead she, like many other trans people, was redirected to helplines run by charities like the Samaritans and local LGBT+ groups. These services, which are often underfunded, are also frequently ill-equipped to deal with issues of gender dysphoria. The lack of interim social and mental health support for transgender patients on waiting lists is concerning, given that transgender individuals already suffer from high rates of depression and anxiety.

An under-resourced NHS

Between 2011 and 2015, the NHS was required to make £20bn of ‘efficiency savings’ as part of the government’s austerity regime. Whilst the government has promised to increase funding for the NHS, the British Medical Association believes that this is still far from enough to properly invest in public medical services. On top of that, the Covid-19 pandemic has added pressure to an already buckling NHS: between April and December 2020, 2.2 million fewer elective treatments were carried out by the NHS than usual. Meanwhile, organisations like the BMA are desperately asking for an immediate increase in the numbers of doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers, saying that staff shortages are one of the biggest threats facing the health service.

In such circumstances, minority care often suffers: there were multiple reports of supposedly “non-essential” gender confirming surgeries being cancelled during the pandemic, and a hormone clinic for under-18s suspended all services. According to medical sociologist Virginia Kuulei Berndt, labelling forms of care as “non-essential” and “elective” often impacts care for marginalised groups, such as LGBT+ people and people living with chronic illness. Just whose care is perceived as “non-essential” is telling.

Shortages of both specialist NHS staff, educators, and time mean areas like trans-specific healthcare are neglected. There is a lack of training for GPs for dealing with transgender and non-binary patients seeking healthcare, a fact acknowledged by the Royal College of General Practitioners in 2019.

“The Royal College of GPs recognises that GPs are not experienced in treating and managing patients with gender dysphoria and trans health issues. Gender dysphoria and gender identity issues are not part of the GP curriculum or GP Specialty Training,” the College wrote in a statement, acknowledging that long waits for specialist clinics are also pushing more patients with gender dysphoria back to untrained GPs for help. In Eva’s experience, this meant she had to spend hours researching and and educating her own GP about transgender issues and the gender-affirmative care she wanted.

“ Due to discrimination and a lack of targeted information and care, transgender individuals may be hesitant to seek out sexual healthcare”

When it comes to healthcare beyond gender-affirming treatments as well, transphobia or clinician unfamiliarity with specialist healthcare can impact treatment. Seventy percent of 697 TransActual survey respondents said they had experienced transphobia while trying to access general healthcare. “Every single thing that could possibly happen to you health-wise is going to be directly credited to the fact you’re taking hormones”, says Rico Jacob Chace, director of TransActual. He recalls a conversation with a transgender person whose health concerns were quickly dismissed as side effects of hormone replacement therapy by their GP.

He’s describing something known as ‘Trans Broken Arm Syndrome’, a term coined in 2016 by Naith Payton, a trans writer, to describe the misguided assumption that “all medical issues are a result of a person being trans”. Consequently trans people’s general health issues are often dismissed.

This means health problems – especially ones related to reproductive systems – can go undetected. According to the Terrence Higgins Trust, a sexual health charity, “despite remarkable progress overall in reducing HIV infection, our trans communities experience high levels of HIV and poor sexual health”. Due to discrimination and a lack of targeted information and care, transgender individuals may be hesitant to seek out sexual healthcare. TransActual’s research saw 27% of transgender and non-binary people report that they ‘always’ or ‘often’ avoided GPs for ‘gender-related’ healthcare such as cervical cancer screenings or prostate checks.

Similarly, researchers found that pregnant transgender men faced structural barriers to accessing regular pregnancy-related care, as well as transphobia from staff and institutional erasure. Not only are healthcare providers failing to provide adequate gender-affirming care to transgender people, but they are also failing across the spectrum of healthcare.

Additional barriers to accessing care

For transgender and non-binary people of colour, additional barriers to receiving specialist healthcare persist. When Mai finally secured an appointment at a Gender Identity Clinic, she was surprised to find that she was almost always the only person of colour in a waiting room full of predominantly white transgender patients. “[This] made me feel a bit uncomfortable, like I’m the only Asian who is trans.”

Her experience reflects a worrying trend: according to one 2019 study, less than 10% of referrals to the Gender Identity Development Service were for young trans people of colour, a figure the researchers described as an “an underrepresentation” compared with both the national population and referrals to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services. The study suggested that the factors behind the stats included cultural and linguistic barriers to accessing care; treatment can also be delayed if parents are unsupportive in referring under 18s for gender-affirmative services.

In the process of being evaluated to receive gender-affirming care, patients are often asked if they are ‘out’ to their families. This, warn activists, can become a form of gatekeeping or put pressure on transgender people to come out to their families, even if it is not safe or strictly necessary to do so. Cultural and religious factors are often overlooked or neglected during the process of providing gender-affirming care. For trans people of colour under the age of 16, the need to involve a parent can pose a problem; 95% of transgender people of colour survyed in TransActual’s report said they’d experienced transphobia from family members and 35% have experienced homelessness in their lifetime.

“I nsidious transphobia also intermingles with Eurocentric beauty standards to impact certain types of care”

“[Healthcare providers] need to take into account [if you’re] a person of colour, your background, heritage, your upbringing, [can mean] it’s a lot more difficult for you to come out to your family,” comments Eva Echo. However, this is difficult to do in the current system, which Eva calls a “a one size fits all” process, where clinicians often lack the time to discuss more nuanced issues. Instead a clinician just “goes through the motions” says Eva, adding that “there’s no real connection to you as a person”.

“When it comes to diversity and inclusion, it’s almost an afterthought these days,” Eva tells me. “What [institutions] really need to be doing is going back to the foundations, ripping it apart and building it back up with inclusion and diversity in there.”

Insidious transphobia also intermingles with Eurocentric beauty standards to impact certain types of care. The concept of ‘passability’ – the ability to be perceived by others as the correct gender – and rigid ideas of adhering to gender binaries can affect the quality of gender-affirming treatment trans people of colour receive.

“Passability affects the way [doctors] treat you and has a major impact on how you get treatment”, Mai tells me. Mai believes that some of her features, such as a visible lack of an Adam’s apple, have helped her pass and experience a quicker and smoother process of accessing care. In contrast, Mai says that transgender women she knows who have a more conventionally ‘masculine’ appearance have reported being treated with contempt by clinicians. Eva recalls a conversation she had with a fellow trans woman who alleged that after years of waiting to see a specialist, a clinician lambasted her for not being “trans enough“ adding that she wasn’t “making enough effort” to be “feminine”.

In his writings, LGBTQI+ health advocate and therapist Y Gavriel Ansara recounts helping transgender clients of colour in the US who had been failed by mainstream health providers. He recalls meeting two Black trans women who were denied hormones and surgeries by non-Black counsellors “who considered them too ‘masculine’ to be women according to non-Black cultural gender norms”, and a transgender man of Asian/Middle Eastern descent who was considered to be too ‘feminine’ to be a transgender man, because he enjoyed wearing brightly coloured scarves and eyeliner.

Eurocentric and binary understandings of gender can prevent transgender people of colour from receiving the affirmative care they desperately need. The standards used to evaluate trans patients tend to favour those who are already the most financially privileged and educated, as well as those who fit into “textbook examples” of binary transgender identity, says Ansara. Those providing gender-affirmative care need to be more accepting of gender diversity and variation in gender norms across cultures.

Consequently, such adherence to gender binaries poses a distressing problem for non-binary individuals in the healthcare system, who often feel pressured to conform to binary narratives of transness in order to access gender-affirmative care and can be denied care for being perceived as not being ‘trans enough’. Because of this, some non-binary people may delay seeking gender-affirming care, even if they want it. Eighty-three percent of non-binary respondents to TransActual’s survey described being ‘very impacted’ by discrimination when accessing trans-specific health services.

This disproportion may be due to racialisation coming into the mix; according to TransActual’s survey, almost half of trans people of colour in the UK identify as non-binary, a significantly higher proportion than their white counterparts. Given that transgender healthcare in the UK is often informed by Western and binary understandings of gender, it’s unsurprising that those who exist outside of this boundary struggle to gain adequate care and understanding. It’s also not a shock that those who have the means to are beginning to seek care outside of the NHS.

The cost of care

Having waited years for her first appointment with an NHS Gender Identity Clinic, Eva decided to start using a private provider for gender-affirming treatment, with the hope she could switch back onto NHS care once she got off the waiting list. “I felt relief in being able to move forward and knowing that there is a system that can be there to support me,” she tells gal-dem. However, her healthcare came at a significant, literal, cost. “Areas of my life have to be put on hold,” Eva says. “For example, [I had to pause] saving for a house and moving onto the property ladder. Having to dip into savings when you are self-employed is also a massive risk”.

For transgender individuals seeking private care for gender-affirming surgery, even an initial assessment can cost up to £500. Those who wish to pursue surgical procedures face an extremely large bill; procedures like top or breast augmentation surgery start from around £6,000 to £7,000. At the higher end, transfeminine genital reconstruction surgery costs around £15,000 and a phalloplasty costs anywhere from £40,000 to £70,000. It’s no wonder that, anecdotally, there are increased reports of trans people heading to foreign destinations for more affordable procedures than are available in the UK, like Mai who was able to go to Thailand for surgery with the financial support of her family.

“ But for many trans people, going private – for gender affirming care or otherwise – simply isn’t an option”

Many important gender-affirming procedures, such as facial feminisation surgery, tracheal shave and hair transplants are not available on the NHS, meaning people have to pay for them out of their own pocket. However, these procedures are vital for some transgender individuals; they can ease the mental pressure of gender dysphoria and help transgender people pass more safely in public spaces. “It’s not just how we sound, it’s how we present to the public when we’re out in society,” Eva tells gal-dem. “For the NHS to boil [our identities] down to gender confirmation surgery, laser hair removal, and hormones [and say] ‘that’s what defines a trans person’, I think is very irresponsible.”

But for many trans people, going private – for gender affirming care or otherwise – simply isn’t an option. Private health care can be prohibitively expensive. This disproportionately burdens transgender people of colour, who are more likely to be financially precarious or low-wage earners. Employment discrimination is also a persistent problem; these factors have seen a disproportionate amount of trans people, mostly women, entering risky spaces like sex work.

Given the high costs of seeking care privately, transgender individuals often turn to crowd-funding platforms, such as GoFundMe, which has seen a 26% increase in UK fundraisers for gender-affirming surgeries between 2019 and 2020. However, being at the mercy of benevolent individuals and opaque algorithms means that fundraisers are an unreliable resource, whose success depends on existing access to large digital platforms. For those with smaller reach, it can feel like the same few pounds are being exchanged between marginalised folk from the LGBTQI+ community, and fundraising patterns often reflect pre-existing social inequalities.

Additionally, some trans people have turned to the so-called “greymarket” for gender affirming care, like hormone treatments. Friends, social media spaces and intra-community networks have become medical supply sites, exacerbated by interruption of already-delayed healthcare during the pandemic. Whilst the greymarket can provide short term relief in easing gender dysphoria for some, taking medication from unofficial sources carries risks and supplies are unstable.

Culture war fallout

Meanwhile, a concerted war waged on trans rights in the media and in the courts, is having a dire effect on trans people’s ability to access healthcare. According to Jo Maugham, lawyer and founder of The Good Law Project, doctors are being discouraged from providing or specialising in transgender healthcare due to the politicisation of trans-related healthcare, at a time where supply of service providers is already failing to meet demand.

“Very few GPs are even comfortable [participating in ‘shared care’ schemes with specialist clinics or private clinics],” agrees Rico. “They’re not comfortable supplying you with the first injection [of hormones]. Unfortunately, I think that’s linked heavily to the legal climate, and some of the ongoing legal cases”.

Legal challenges from anti-trans campaigners are also attempting to roll back existing healthcare provisions; the recent Bell vs Tavistock case saw Keira Bell, who detransitioned at age 22, attempt to prevent reversible puberty blockers being prescribed to children under the age of 16. The judgement, which initially ruled in Bell’s favour, was overturned in September after an appeal, but had seen treatment suspended for over a year for any new referrals to the UK’s only gender identity service for children.

Jo Maugham, who brought the appeal in the Bell case, says he’s witnessed “a very rapid deterioration in the cultural climate around trans rights” in the UK. “Trans people are pawns on somebody else’s political chessboard,” he says. For Maugham, the recent attacks on transgender rights represent a wider threat to the rights of marginalised groups.

“ Fundamental structural changes must also happen, like bringing non-surgical care for trans individuals into primary healthcare provided by GPs”

“How quickly respect for and understanding of trans people has been rolled back in the UK should be a powerful warning […] as to what will happen to other communities,” Maugham cautions, pointing to the recent near-total ban on abortions in Texas. His words have due cause; lawyers who lost the Bell appeal have announced their intention to challenge the Gillick competency test, which allows children under 16 to consent to their own treatment and access things like sexual healthcare without compulsory parental involvement.

“Healthcare should not be an ideological battlefield,” says Maugham.

Transgender activists and those who stand in solidarity are mounting a fightback for better healthcare provisions for transgender people, through the courts and on the ground. As a consequence of the distressingly long waiting lists, Eva has decided to take legal action, alongside three other trans plaintiffs, against the NHS, with the support from the Good Law Project.

From providing training for doctors to be more trans-inclusive, to rebuilding services that specifically have trans people, both white and of colour, involved in governance from the beginning, a wide-range of radical changes urgently need to take place to improve healthcare for transgender people. For many transgender individuals, gender-affirming care is life-saving care. In a 2012 survey by the Scottish Trans Alliance, 58% participants said their mental health deteriorated during their long wait for specialist care, whilst 74% of those who transitioned felt their mental health improved.

Fundamental structural changes must also happen, like bringing non-surgical care for trans individuals into primary healthcare provided by GPs, or run more akin to sexual health clinics, where people can access specific services without GP referral. A Soho clinic, for example, is running a pilot where eligible trans and non-binary patients waiting for their first GIC appointment can receive an official gender dysphoria diagnosis and access other gender-related services without a GP referral.

Access to decent and timely healthcare is a human right. “Every life should matter to a doctor,” says Mai, firmly. “No matter who you are.”

Terence Burke brought claims of disability discrimination and unfair dismissal after being sacked from his job as a caretaker in 2021. He had worked in the role since 2001, but had been unable to attend work for nine months after suffering substantial and long-term effects from COVID-19 after contracting the virus in November 2020.

The tribunal considered and decided at a preliminary hearing that Mr Burke’s symptoms during this time amounted to a disability within the definition of the Equality Act 2010. The Tribunal gave Mr Burke permission to proceed with his claim of disability discrimination against his former employer.

The judgement referenced a TUC report from June 2021 about workers’ experience of long COVID, and supported what the claimant said about the recurrence of the symptoms.

The judgement also noted that occupational health evidence had been unhelpful for the claimant, highlighting a challenge for UNISON members and representatives who are facing similar problems.

Employment Tribunal decisions are not binding, but they are persuasive, and may still be used by negotiators to point to employers the direction a tribunal might take in similar circumstances.

Man unable to get dentist over lockdown resorts to ripping own teeth out

A man has told how he had to extract five of his teeth as there were no NHS dentists in his area available to take him on thanks to closures during the pandemic

Exclusive: Desperate man who couldn't get NHS dentist pulls out 5 of his teeth with pliers

A man has spoken about the ""excruciating"" pain he says he suffered while extracting five of his own teeth over the course of a two-year period.

Ferdi, 51, says there were no available NHS dentists within a 25-mile radius of his home city of Wakefield, and, unable to bear the pain any longer, he took action into his own hands.

Photographer Ferdi, who has recently completed his PhD in political philosophy, has since tried to seek private dental treatment to fix his mouth, but was shocked to receive a quote of £16,000, far more than he was able to afford.

His first venture into DIY dentistry came at the beginning of the pandemic when he found he was unable to even see an emergency dentist.

Feeling as though he was ""teetering on the edge of like insanity due to sleep deprivation"", Ferdi made the painful decision to extract the tooth himself, using a pair of ordinary household pliers.

Speaking to the Mirror, Ferdi said: ""I grabbed hold of it and started to pull. Oh my God, the pain. The pain was just excruciating. It just went all across the side of my face is absolute agony. I thought, 'just keep pulling. Keep pulling'.

""So I kept pulling and it was just agony. But then I could hear the bones cracking, and then it just came out.

""The relief from just having been in absolute agony, pulling it out, the relief was just phenomenal. And there's blood everywhere. It was a mess. And I was like, 'well, I hope I never have to do that again'.""



Unfortunately, Ferdi ended up performing a further four tooth extractions on himself. The first ones were at the back, but the more recent ones were at the front, leaving him with a considerable gap that he compares to that of 'a ten-year-old'.

Image: © Richard Walker / ImageNorth) © Richard Walker / ImageNorth)

Unable to afford treatment for dentures, Ferdi, who is currently receiving benefits, now has to live with large gaps in his teeth. He says he's no longer in pain, but the loss has made everyday activities such as eating very difficult.

Ferdi continued: ""My teeth are staggered now. There's not one tooth on top on top of another tooth, they're kind of staggered. So I can't chew on anything.

""I'm having to chew my food using my teeth, which obviously is not a good idea. I mean, your two front teeth are not designed for chewing, but that's what I'm having do, and it's just a nightmare.""

Fortunately, Ferdi says he isn't currently in any pain, while his remaining teeth feel 'pretty solid'. However, he says his mouth is now a 'complete mess', and 'not fit for purpose'.

He's still looking for a dentist to help him, but can't find one within a 30-mile radius. He has previously tried to find a private dentist, but realised this just wouldn't be doable after he was quoted £16,000.

West Yorkshire is known to have been an access hotspot for some time, however, the pressures of the pandemic have seen the situation worsen, while other affecting many areas of the country.

Recent BBC research has found that 9 out of 10 practices are unable to take on new adult NHS patients, with Wakefield being among the worst access points anywhere in England, with 97% of practices not taking on any new adult patients.

Image: © Richard Walker / ImageNorth) © Richard Walker / ImageNorth)

The British Dental Association (BDA) says it would take an extra £880 million a year simply to restore resources to 2010 levels, and believes government objectives to improve both access and retention cannot feasibly be achieved within the financial constraints set by the current Treasury.

With this in mind, the BDA is now calling upon Prime Minister Liz Truss, Secretary of State for Health and Social Care Liz Truss, and Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng to take action now as a matter of urgency.

British Dental Association Chair Eddie Crouch said: ""DIY dentistry has no place in a wealthy, 21st-century nation, but today millions have no options, and some are taking matters into their own hands.

“These access problems are not inevitable. This horror show is the direct result of choices made in Westminster. We’ve heard promises of change, but any progress requires action on a decade of underfunding and failed contracts. Truss, Coffey, and Kwarteng will determine whether we consign these scenes back to the Victorian era.”

Furthermore, Ferdi's story does not appear to be a one-off incident. According to a recent poll commissioned by the Liberal Democrats, one in five (21%) people who failed to get an NHS dentist appointment over the course of the past year have instead turned to DIY dentistry.

An NHS spokesperson told the Mirror: ""Infection prevention and control measures introduced during the pandemic to protect staff and patients have now been lifted so dental teams can operate at full capacity for the first time in two years.

""Anyone with concerns about their dental health should contact their local dentist as they usually would or seek advice from NHS 111.”

The Mirror has contacted the Department of Health & Social Care for comment.

On November 29 and 30, we and our co-claimants will be arguing that these waiting times – and other failures in trans healthcare services – are discriminatory and unlawful.

Here’s what you need to know about the case.

What’s the issue?

NHS England has a legal duty to see 92% of children and young people who are referred to the Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS), and adults referred to the Gender Dysphoria Clinics (GDCs, previously GICs) within 18 weeks.

Good Law Project is powered by people across the UK Donate now

Despite this, the average waiting time for young people is nearly three years, with some waiting significantly longer. Similarly, many adults have faced wait times of four years or more.

This means thousands of people are being denied the specialist healthcare they need, which can have serious consequences for their mental health. Eva Echo, one of the claimants in this case, explained: “I would describe being on the waiting list as torture, and there were times when I felt that I may not even be alive long enough to receive my first appointment. Being on the waiting list was no comfort; I desperately needed help.”

These delays also mean teenagers are missing the short window of time in which they can secure puberty blockers, if they need them. With such a long wait for safe treatment, some feel they have no choice but to self-medicate with drugs purchased on the dark web.

This situation predates the pandemic by a long margin.

Why is this happening?

In England, it is almost impossible for trans people to get timely access to healthcare they are entitled to. One reason for this is the sheer lack of specialist centres.

There is just one service for trans young people in the whole of England, though the closure of this service and its replacement with a “localised approach” has been announced for Spring 2023. There are only a handful of services for adults.

The UK is an international outlier when it comes to the lack of trans healthcare, particularly for young people.

What are we doing about it?

We’re bringing a claim against NHS England alongside two adult claimants, Eva and Alex, two child claimants, and trans-led grassroots charity Gendered Intelligence, arguing that it is failing to fulfil its legal duty of offering a first appointment within 18 weeks.

We are also arguing that these waiting times are discriminatory, as the delays faced by trans people are far longer than those faced by other people waiting for treatment.

This is about individuals getting important and, in some cases, life saving care.

What are we hoping to achieve?

We are asking the court for a declaration that NHS England has been acting unlawfully in relation to its provision of healthcare to trans children and adults.

While we recognise the strain NHS England is under, it must fulfil its legal duty of offering a first appointment within 18 weeks.

The Government must start listening to trans people, their families and medical experts about the care they need and commission more services so people are not deprived of the healthcare and support that is readily available in other countries.

Almost 5% of the UK workforce are struggling with long COVID. UNISON’s legal advice is clear that the Equality Act 2010 means that anyone with a long-term physical or mental impairment, which has a substantial impact on their day-to-day activities, is likely to be a disabled person.

On 9 May, the EHRC tweeted that workers with long COVID were unlikely to be disabled. In response, Ms McAnea has demanded that the tweet be deleted.

“This is a clear misrepresentation of how long COVID should be considered under the Equality Act 2010. Many of our members with long COVID meet the definition and were shocked to see such a fundamental misunderstanding of the law from Britain’s national equality body.”

Although the EHRC published a clarifying statement on 11 May, the original tweet is still in place and has not been removed.

UNISON national officer for disability equality Deirdre Costigan said: “Our members living with long COVID shouldn’t have to put up with confusing and downright wrong advice from Britain’s top equality body.

“Our reps have enough to deal with trying to persuade sometimes reluctant employers that workers who have had long COVID for over 12 months are entitled to be treated as disabled people if their symptoms are having a substantial impact on their everyday lives.

“These members have the right to reasonable adjustments such as flexible hours and changes to sickness absence triggers and the EHRC needs to make this abundantly clear.”

In the letter, Ms McAnea explains: “Many good employers who want to do the right thing may continue to wrongly understand their legal obligations as a result of seeing the uncorrected tweet.

“The worst employers might use the tweet to avoid their obligations towards disabled staff, such as the duty to provide reasonable adjustments.”"

Labour Force Survey (LFS)

The Labour Force Survey (LFS) is a UK quarterly household survey of approximately 90,000 individuals each quarter. The survey does not cover communal establishments, except for NHS staff accommodation. Those living in student halls of residence or boarding school are included as part of their family household.

Annual Population Survey (APS)

The Annual Population Survey (APS) is an annual survey based on data collected in Wave 1 and Wave 5 on the LFS, combined with an annual local area boost sample run in England, Wales and Scotland.

The survey does not cover communal establishments, except for NHS staff accommodation. Those living in student halls of residence or boarding school are included as part of their family household. The APS dataset contains approximately 300,000 individuals.

Coverage and population of the APS and LFS

Analysis conducted using the APS and the LFS has been restricted to those aged between 16 to 64 years in the case of employment, housing and well-being analysis. This is because the survey does not collect data for those aged under 16 years, and the disability variable is not robust for those aged over 64 years.

The APS datasets are produced for four different overlapping 12-month periods:

January to December

April to March

July to June

October to September

Analysis for this publication was conducted for the July 2020 to June 2021 period for most breakdowns.

Community Life Survey (CLS)

The Community Life Survey (CLS) is a household self-completion survey of approximately 10,000 people aged 16 years and over in England only. It is used to calculate social participation and loneliness proportions. The survey can be completed either in a paper or online format; the question regarding disability status is asked online only. Analysis was conducted on the year ending March 2021.

The loneliness and social participation analysis is restricted to people aged 16 years and over and to England only, as the CLS does not collect data for those aged under 16 years or the other countries in the UK. In each domain, participation refers to any involvement in the 12 months prior to completing the survey. For more detail, see the accompanying methodology article.

Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW)

The analysis presented in this release uses data from the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW). This is a face-to-face victimisation survey, which asks approximately 35,000 respondents aged 16 years and over residing in households in England and Wales about their experiences of crime in the 12 months prior to the interview. Individuals residing in group residences (for example, care homes or halls of residence) or other institutions are not included in the CSEW sample.

In establishing WHSSC to work on their behalf, the seven Local Health Boards (LHBs) recognised that the most efficient and effective way of planning these services was to work together to reduce duplication and ensure consistency.

If you wish to contact WHSSC, please use the contact page, given the current working conditions, there may be a delay in our responding to general enquiries. In an emergency please call the Royal Glamorgan Hospital on 01443 443 443 and for the WHSSC On-call Executive."

Policy for non-attenders: If you miss an appointment without having informed us, we will offer one further appointment. If you do not attend this appointment, you will be removed from our waiting list and will need to return to your GP and request a new referral to the Welsh Gender Service.

The Welsh Gender Service (WGS) was established in 2019. The WGS operates as part of a network involving local clinicians to ensure that care is offered closer to home, via your Local Health Board.

The WGS is based in St David’s Hospital in Cardiff. Appointments can take place at the WGS itself, or online, or at our North Wales satellite clinic in Holywell. There are plans for further satellite clinics to be set up by the end of 2024.

Referral to the Welsh Gender Service

You can access the Welsh Gender Service if you are over 18 and are registered with a Welsh GP. You should ask your GP to make an electronic referral. If they are not sure how to do this they can contact us and we’ll help them with the process.

We can accept referrals from GPs for patients who are aged 17 and over; but you and your GP should understand that you will not become a patient of the WGS until you have turned 18, and responsibility will remain with your GP until that point.

Patients who are under 17 who wish to access gender services should ask their GP for a referral to Child and Adult Mental Health Services (CAMHS) in the first instance. Once a young person reaches 17, their file should be transferred to the WGS automatically.

What happens after referral?

You will join the WGS waiting list; when you move towards the top you’ll receive a phone call to arrange an appointment; following this you’ll receive a letter to confirm the details. If you have opted in, you will also receive text reminders about your appointment.

If we can’t get in touch with you by phone, we’ll send a letter asking you to contact us and it is really important that you do this within two weeks of receiving the letter. If we don’t hear from you we will assume you no longer require an appointment.

Unfortunately, a high number of patients do not attend for their appointments at the Welsh Gender Service, and this means longer wait times for everyone on our list. If you know you will not be able to attend your appointment in advance, please call us on 029 2183 6619 so that we can reschedule and offer someone else the cancelled slot.

Appointments and patient journey

Following your first appointment there are various stages to the patient journey, delivered by various providers. The table below provides an explainer of what your pathway may include.

Lord Shinkwin has introduced a Private Members’ Bill this week that, if passed into law, would gravely violate fundamental human rights in pregnancy.

Lord Shinkwin was appointed a Commissioner by the Government Equalities Office earlier this year, and has since then been lobbying in public for the EHRC to take up the Bill. Voice for Choice is also concerned that this contravenes the codes of conduct that come with his role.

The Bill

If the Abortion (Disability Equality) Bill were to become law, then the Abortion Act 1967 would be amended to stipulate that women would no longer have the option to end a pregnancy after 24 weeks when faced with a serious antenatal diagnosis. This includes cases where there is no realistic possibility of a pregnancy resulting in a baby able to survive after birth.

On multiple occasions, UN bodies have ruled that denying women abortion in cases of fatal foetal abnormality violates their human rights. The United Nations Human Rights Committee (UNHRC) has twice ruled that the denial of abortions in the Republic of Ireland in the case of a fatal foetal abnormality violated women’s rights to be free from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, and to privacy and equality.

As foetal anomalies are often only diagnosed at 18 to 21 weeks, amending current abortion law would have catastrophic implications for women who receive an antenatal diagnosis. Removing the ability to have such abortions post-24 weeks would force women to make a rapid decision at an incredibly difficult time and severely limit opportunities to engage with specialist healthcare professionals and third sector organisations. Women and their partners would be denied the support they deserve.

Jane Fisher, Director of Antenatal Results and Choices (the only national charity helping parents and healthcare professionals through antenatal screening and its consequences) said: “We speak regularly to expectant parents on our helpline who have been given devastating news from their 20 week scan and require further tests to gain as much information as possible on the implications for their baby. Without this ground for abortion, post-24 weeks, such parents would be put under intolerable pressure. Some would have to make a hurried decision to terminate at 23 weeks, foregoing further investigations, if they do not wish to carry a baby with a fatal or severely debilitating condition to term”.

Jayne Spink PhD, Chief Executive of Genetic Alliance UK said: “There are a significant number of genetic conditions that result in still-birth or severe neonatal illness that prove lethal very early on in life. The quality of life of a child born with such severe health problems is extremely poor and the impact upon their parents and families can be enormous. What is usually a happy event, the birth of a child, is turned into a crisis. Such an experience can be so devastating that couples may choose not to try for another child. Reproductive choice remains an incredibly important option for women at risk of having an affected child. The Bill seeks to limit choice and in doing so will bring about avoidable harm.”

Complaint

Lord Shinkwin has repeatedly spoken out about his Bill, including during purdah, and has attacked the EHRC for not readily supporting his Bill both in the media and in Parliament. Voice for Choice believes that his behaviour has broken a number of codes of conduct that govern Commissioners’ behaviour, including that ‘Individual Commissioners… commenting on matters in their Commission capacity or on a topic within the Commission’s remit… will normally be expected to support [our established lines]. These protocols apply even where the request is made in a non-Commission capacity, as any comments made may nevertheless be linked back to the Commission. Commissioners… should also be clear to stakeholders and the media when they are speaking in a non-Commission capacity, and take care their actions do not compromise or conflict with the role as a member of the Board or Committee.’

Further quotes from Voice for Choice members:

A Humanists UK spokesperson commented: “Lord Shinkwin’s Bill, if passed into law, would lead to some of those who need an abortion the most from being unable to access it. It is simply horrific that women would be forced to carry to term foetuses that are not viable, and for this reason we very much expect that the Equality and Human Rights Commission will not support the Bill, but instead put a stop to his behaviour which is utterly inappropriate for a sitting Commissioner.”

A spokesperson from Doctors for a Woman’s Choice on Abortion said: “If Lord Shinkwin’s Bill became law it would inevitably force some women carrying a foetus with a fatal or severely debilitating abnormality to continue with their pregnancy and give birth. This would be unspeakably cruel, with serious consequences for their mental health as well as the mental health of their partners and any existing children. There are also a number of foetal conditions such as severe hydrops where continuing the pregnancy seriously compromises women’s health and can even endanger their lives.

As doctors we are committed to doing the best for our patients. This Bill would seriously undermine our ability to fulfil this legal, professional and moral duty and at a time when women desperately need our help and support.

We are also deeply concerned about Lord Shinkwin’s role and Equality and Human Rights Commissioner, and believe that bringing this Bill calls into question his suitability for this important position.”

We are not talking here about Covid-19, but about links that have been proven beyond reasonable doubt.

This page is against wireless 5G, radiofrequency radiation (“RFR”) and electromagnetic fields (“EMFs”) generally due to their impact on the health of humans, animals and plants.

Many people are sensitive to RFR and EMFs and suffer illness, distress and financial loss due to inability to work. The balance of scientific evidence is now clear that RFR/EMFs are harmful to humans.

The UK government insist on using ICNIRP’s guidelines to set limits of radiation for public health. ICNIRP’s guidelines are not fit for purpose as, among other things, they only recognise harm from heating of the body and are set for short term exposure – 6 minutes in fact. Many people suffer harm without any heating of their bodies.

5G is the fifth generation of RFR technology used in the mobile telecoms industry and follows 1G – 4G. It dwarfs RFR from 1G – 4G because millions more masts, antennae, small cells, picocells etc have to be placed at short distances apart all around the country in order to develop the infrastructure to deliver the data speed promised by 5G.

The current electrosmog from 1G – 4G will become significantly worse and it is likely to result in more harm to humans, animals, trees and pollinators.

Many people have tried to engage with the government and its agencies, including Public Health England, over the last few years in an attempt to persuade them that their existing policies are harmful to human, animal and plant health. The government rejects such approaches and insists on its adherence to ICNIRP’s guidelines. It has removed health concerns from the National Planning Policy Framework, thereby removing the ability of its citizens from raising such concerns at local council level. Its Electronic Communications Code has limited the rights of its citizens to object to equipment being put on their land. It has permitted the proliferation of RFR gadgets used by babies and children without constraint.

These policies are likely to result in harm to UK residents. There are likely to be many breaches of English law but a few may be breaches to duties to safeguard public health, breaches of the environmental legislation, breaches of human rights and breaches of the public sector equality duty. The public sector equality duty is relevant because the government, in promoting these harmful policies, is likely to be doing so without considering people who are electrohypersensitive and who are, thereby, disabled under the terms of the Equality Act.

What are we trying to achieve?

I am trying:

to obtain a change of government policy to stop the harm to UK residents, which would include: an immediate halt to the roll out of 5G infrastructure until it is proven to be safe; Direct all such businesses and persons to turn off all equipment which propagate wireless 5G signals including without limitation masts, antennae, wifi (including in schools), small cells; Direct all products which use 5G wireless technology to be recalled as they are not safe; Direct that the manufacture of all products using 5G wireless technology be halted.

Require the government to ensure that the industry lays cabling for the purposes of upgrades in technology rather than relying on wireless technology generating RFR and EMFs;

Require the government to examine all equipment and gadgets generating RFR and to take steps to ensure that such equipment does not cause harm to humans.

What's at stake?

The government and media state that there is no harm to humans from 5G. This is wrong. The majority of scientific evidence show that there is harm. The burden for illnesses which may result from 5G and other RFR will fall on the NHS and ultimately on the taxpayer. This too is wrong. The government are tasked with safeguarding the health of the nation and they are now being called to account for their failure to honour their duty to do so.

Many people who are electrohypersensitive have a limited involvement in public life or are excluded from public life because RFR in public spaces is so prevalent that they feel ill in such environments. Some are prisoners in their own homes, unable to go out and they struggle to live a normal life. A change in policy will, at the very least, see safe corridors being formed for such persons so that they too can participate in public life by enjoying public spaces and public venues.

UK residents are unaware of the harm that is being caused to themselves, their children and babies who are exposed to RFR to the extent that they are in today’s world. This case will, hopefully, change the government’s stance and ensure that they are aware of the potential harm so that they can either agree to participate in an RFR environment or they can live in their homes and public spaces free from RFR.

More about this important case:

Who am I?

I am a solicitor. I became involved in understanding the harmful health impact of 5G when a member of my community alerted me to an application to put a mast on the building opposite her apartment. She was electrohypersensitive.

I started to investigate the nature of 5G including reading articles, scientific literature, the appeal by 240 scientists from around the world to pause the rollout of 5G pending proper health studies into its impact and discussed the position with various scientists, doctors and weapons experts. I spoke to many others who have written to their MPs, local councils, government departments, the Prime Minister, telecoms and infrastructure companies, Ofcom and others about the harm to humans, animals, trees, pollinators etc with no success.

I have come to the conclusion that taking legal action is the only way to bring this issue into a public forum and to examine the government and Public Health England’s stance on this matter.

I may be a claimant in this matter but if there are others who are more suited to be claimants in these claims, then they will proceed as claimants using the funds which I have raised on this page.

What is the next step in the case?

With the help of Tim Buley QC of Landmark Chambers, as a first step, the High Court will be asked to review the stance taken by the Secretary of State for the Department of Health and Social Care and Public Health England. The claim will be for judicial review of their policy of using ICNIRP’s guidelines to set the limits of public exposure which I and many other scientists say is too high, thereby, causing harm to humans.

I need Tim Buley QC to review the case, draft the application for judicial review, appear at any hearing relating to the application, prepare the case for a hearing and appear in court to present our case. I will be the solicitor acting in the case through LCS Practice Ltd and will charge just less than half of my normal hourly rate for work done. My normal hourly rate is £450 per hour plus VAT and I will charge £200 plus VAT per hour.

How much are we raising and why?

I am raising £150,000 to cover the legal and other costs and contingencies mentioned above including costs for the other side in the event of failure of the judicial review application - the Aarhus Convention cap of up to £10,000 will be claimed.

For overnight stays in hospital, since 2010 there has been a policy of “single-sex wards” recognising that sex matters in interactions with other patients.
After carefully setting up a system to record both sex and social gender, the NHS does not use it.
People requesting their medical records commonly find that the sex field is left blank and their sex is recorded as their gender.

More than ten years ago the NHS recognised the need for clear systems for recording biological sex and social gender. It carefully set up a system of data and definitions which could deal with both. The official data standard written in 2009 explained:

“The term ‘Gender’ is now considered too ambiguous to be desirable or safe… “ Sex and Current Gender Input and Display User Interface Design Guidance

The data standard set out definitions for patient “sex” and “current gender” and warned:

“Users may confuse the terms current gender and sex, or assume that they are synonymous. Therefore, it is essential that all NHS applications display and explain current gender and sex terminology and values in a clear and consistent manner.” Sex and Current Gender Input and Display User Interface Design Guidance

The NHS recognised that sex also matters in relation to interactions with healthcare professionals. For example, patients can request to be seen by a GP of a particular sex, or to have a chaperone for any procedure. For overnight stays in hospital, since 2010 there has been a policy of “single-sex wards” recognising that sex matters in interactions with other patients.

As Andrew Lansley, the then Health Secretary, said:

“Patients should not suffer the indignity of being cared for in mixed-sex accommodation. I am determined to put an end to this practice, where it is not clinically justified.”

Lansley promised that patients would be in single-sex accommodation, such as a bay which only consists of people of the same sex, and they should be able to access washing and toilet facilities without having to pass through a part of the ward or another ward where there might be people of the opposite sex. He called this “the kind of privacy and dignity people have a right to expect”.

What is the problem?

In practice the NHS has adopted gender self-identification, completely undermining these policies.

After carefully setting up a system to record both sex and social gender, the NHS does not use it. People requesting their medical records commonly find that the sex field is left blank and their sex is recorded as their gender. This can then be changed at a patient’s request – but it means that nobody’s sex is reliably recorded.

This means that patients’ health can be put in danger if their sex is not communicated to healthcare staff.

Across the healthcare service doctors, managers and inspectors are being told to mentally replace sex with “gender identity” at all times. This creates a loophole in their ability to identify inappropriate behaviour and abuse of power which relate to sex.

These policies are embedded across institutions, covering both patients and healthcare professionals:

Patient records – The GMC tells doctors to change a patient’s sex as recorded on medical records on request. This does not require any medical diagnosis, anatomical changes or a gender-recognition certificate. Doctors and other healthcare professionals are warned not to “disclose a patient’s gender history” (i.e. sex) “unless it is directly relevant to the condition or its likely treatment”.

Doctors and other healthcare professionals are warned not to “disclose a patient’s gender history” (i.e. sex) “unless it is directly relevant to the condition or its likely treatment”. GP surgeries – Public Health England tells GP surgeries to change a patient’s recorded sex on their medical record at any time, without requiring diagnosis or any form of gender-reassignment treatment. They are given a new NHS number and previous medical information must be transferred into a newly created medical record. They will be sent screening appointments (for example, for cervical smear tests or prostate cancer screen) according to their new gender – that is, invitations to attend the wrong screenings.

They will be sent screening appointments (for example, for cervical smear tests or prostate cancer screen) according to their new gender – that is, invitations to attend the wrong screenings. “Pride in Practice” is a “quality assurance” scheme run by the LGBT Foundation. It works with GP practices, dental surgeries, pharmacies and optometrists. Its philosophy is that it is important to encourage healthcare professionals to record a person’s trans status and sexual orientation, but not to record their sex. It advises that on transferring medical records “any information relating to the patient’s previous gender identity should not be included in the new record” if it reveals their sex.

Doctors – The General Medical Council register lists all doctors practising in the United Kingdom, showing their registration status, training and “gender” (male or female, so actually sex). Doctors are allowed to self-identify their gender. If they change change their name and ask for their “gender marker” to be changed, a new GMC number is issued – so that there is no accurate public record of the person’s career as a doctor.

Doctors are allowed to self-identify their gender. If they change change their name and ask for their “gender marker” to be changed, a new GMC number is issued – so that there is no accurate public record of the person’s career as a doctor. Hospital staff – NHS hospital trusts (such as West Suffolk, Cambridgeshire and Peterborough, Brighton and Sussex) practice self-identity for all staff. The gender identity of staff is allowed to replace their sex on records and in policies, and there is no consideration of how this impacts on the rights of patients who may want to see a healthcare professional or a chaperone of a particular sex.

Patients who request to see a female doctor may find themselves being examined by a doctor who is male, without their consent. Without clear policies for obtaining consent and addressing the difference between sex and gender, professionals may find themselves put into positions which patients experience as assault.

And “single sex” hospital wards in practice are mixed sex according to NHS policy which states that:

“Trans people should be accommodated according to their presentation: the way they dress, and the name and pronouns they currently use. This may not always accord with the physical sex appearance of the chest or genitalia… Non-binary individuals, who do not identify as being male or female, should be allocated to the male or female ward according to their choice.”

This approach undermines the privacy, dignity and wellbeing of other patients, for example:

“A Lancaster mum whose bi-polar disorder left her believing men were conspiring to kill her said she was left terrified when she was locked on a women’s psychiatric ward with an ‘extremely male-bodied’ transgender patient. When she raised her concerns with hospital staff, however, she said she was not taken seriously and her medical notes implied that she was a ‘transphobic bigot’.”

The Care Quality Commission inspects healthcares services to check if they are safe, effective, caring, responsive to people’s needs, and well led, including whether it has systems to identify the possibility of abuse and prevent abuse from happening. If you can’t envisage the possibility of a risk (or you can, but are prevented from speaking about it) then you cannot begin to consider what reasonable steps could be taken to protect the needs of everybody.

The CQC’s equality statement tellingly omits the Equality Act’s protected characteristic of sex (and mistakenly replaces “gender reassignment” with “gender reassignment/identity/expression”). Like so many public bodies, the CQC is a member of the Stonewall Champions scheme. Its management at the highest level has set an objective to gain a higher placement on the Stonewall Index. The equality strategy mentions Stonewall three times. The words female and sex do not appear once."

Dr Christopher Bear, based at Cardiff University’s School of Geography and Planning, said: “Young people’s voices are becoming increasingly prominent in discussions on environmental futures and animal welfare. Embodied in Greta Thunberg’s Fridays for Future movement, their highlighting of intensive livestock farming’s greenhouse gas emissions has been especially high-profile.

“But there is still little research on how these values translate into food consumption attitudes and practices among children. This research project is an opportunity for us to find out how young people of primary age envisage the role of edible insects and plant-based proteins in more sustainable and ethical food futures.”

Dr Verity Jones of UWE Bristol said: “The introduction of the new curriculum in Wales, which puts an emphasis on developing ethical and sustainable citizenship through formal education, gives us an opportunity to work with schools so that teachers are given the right tools and children are empowered to explore some of these complex issues.

“While focusing on Wales, the findings and resources will speak to similar concerns and developments internationally.”

Carl Evans, Headteacher of Roch Community Primary School in Pembrokeshire, which is taking part in the project, said: “At the school we recognise the important connection between our local community, food production and wider global issues surrounding sustainable development. We know these issues are important to children, but also difficult to make sense of and can often be confusing for them. We welcome the opportunity to work with academics from Cardiff and UWE Bristol to explore these issues and support children in developing critical thinking around sustainable citizenship.”

Consumers in the UK have shown an increased demand for healthy, sustainable diets, with a focus on reducing traditional meat products such as beef and chicken.

A recent study found that over seven million adults in the UK follow a meat-free diet and a further six million intended to shift to vegetarian or vegan diets. Meat-free diets were most prevalent among those aged 18-23. Most existing studies on attitudes to alternative proteins focus on adults; this new research fills an important gap in shifting the attention to children as important and influential consumers.

Although the consumption of insects as food is relatively new to the UK, it is practiced by two billion people globally, particularly in Asia, Latin America and Africa. They are increasingly being sold across the EU. In the UK, the Food Standards Agency is currently assessing house crickets for human consumption.

Plant-based proteins are now popular products at supermarkets in the UK, promoted on the basis of their environmental sustainability in comparison to other livestock sectors, as well as their high nutritional value."

“Patients accessing NHS dental care should be advised of their personalised recall interval based upon an assessment of their oral health risk,” it adds.

The NHS in England has announced a number of measures to help get more people to see their dentist.

This includes a push for more people to take advantage of longer intervals between check-ups to free up access for more urgent cases.

Meanwhile, dentists have been ordered to publish up-to-date information on whether or not they are taking new NHS patients in a bid to improve access for patients.

Patients have been known to call up to 40 practises to find an NHS dentist taking on new patients.

The NHS will also give dental therapists more responsibilities.

Dental therapists can carry out a range of treatments including fillings, performing X-rays and putting in crowns.

Under previous guidance they were only allowed to do a filling after being instructed by a dentist but the NHS has said they can now instigate the procedure.

This will free up time for dentists to conduct more complex work, the NHS said.

A letter to dental practices setting out the reforms states there is “limited evidence” for the need for six-monthly check-ups for people with “low oral health risk”.

“Patients accessing NHS dental care should be advised of their personalised recall interval based upon an assessment of their oral health risk,” it adds.

“For some people, this might mean that a recall interval of less than six months may be advised. However, for those with good oral health we expect to see recall intervals more usually to be 12 months, or even 24 months.”

Many people are used to checking in with their dentist every six months for a full assessment of their mouth, teeth and gums.

This gives dentists an opportunity to look for signs of tooth decay or symptoms of oral cancer, among other illnesses.

The plans have emerged as part of a reformed contract for NHS dentists.

But the British Dental Association (BDA) said the measures only “paper over the cracks”.

It warned that there are no dental therapists “waiting in the wings” to step up and care for more patients.

Shawn Charlwood, chair of the BDA’s General Dental Practice Committee, said: “These are modest, marginal changes that will not fix the rotten foundations this service is built on.

“Our patients need ministers to do more than paper over the cracks. These tweaks will do precious little to keep dentists in the NHS or ensure millions get the care they urgently need.”

Chief Dental Officer for England Sara Hurley said: “The NHS is determined to overhaul dental provision, with a focus on increasing access to necessary dental care and supporting prevention, today’s reforms are the first step on that journey.

“NHS dental staff are working hard to recover services, but the key to delivering this will be reform – these changes announced today will help teams carry out even more treatments and help address the inevitable backlogs that have built up during the pandemic.”

Health and Social Care Secretary Steve Barclay said: “Improving patient access to NHS dental care is a priority and these changes are an important step, while also rewarding dentists more fairly for providing more complex care, allowing the best performing practices to see more patients and making better use of the range of professionals working in the sector such as nurses hygienists, and dental therapists.”

Chris McCann, from Healthwatch England, which has been campaigning for better dentistry access, said: “The changes will make it easier for people to see which dentists are taking on new NHS patients.

“Those with more complex dental problems should also have better access to care because of the shift in how the NHS pays dentists. Ultimately we hope these combined measures will end long waiting times, the extended periods of pain many people suffer, and the extreme cases of DIY dentistry we have seen.”"

UK doctors are warning that a decision to overturn 50-year-old legislation legalising abortion in the US is likely to be dangerous to women.

Today the US Supreme Court struck down the landmark Roe v Wade decision which ensured women had the constitutional right to a termination of pregnancy.

Around half of US states are widely expected to enshrine a ban on abortion in law.

Thirteen states have already passed so-called trigger laws to automatically outlaw abortion following the Supreme Court’s ruling.

In the UK women can seek an abortion up to 24 weeks of pregnancy by self-referring to a clinic, speaking to their GP or via family planning services. After this period abortions are available in very limited circumstances such as life-threatening situations.

It will not prevent abortions.

The British Medical Association (BMA) is warning that the ban will only drive women away from places of safety to seek abortions in other states, dangerous underground abortion clinics or even self-administered abortions.

Chair of the BMA medical ethics committee Dr Zoe Greaves explains, “Banning or severely restricting abortion prevents only the safe termination of pregnancy – it does not prevent abortions.

“If women are denied necessary and appropriate care they will be forced to travel out of their home state to access services, something which is also being suggested will be made illegal. It could also drive abortion services underground and lead to an increase in self-administered abortions, placing the most vulnerable of women at greatest risk of harm.

Dr Greaves continues, “Restricting abortion will harm ‘rural, minority and poor patients’ the most according to leading health organisations in the US.

“We will now be considering the implications of the Opinion in more detail and how we can best support our fellow national medical association – the American Medical Association (AMA) – in its opposition to the criminalisation of reproductive health.”"

Many studies show that eating less meat is just as crucial to slowing down global warming as using solar panels and zero-emissions vehicles. Animal farming generates an obscene amount of greenhouse gas emissions.

That’s why the demand for alternatives to animal meat has surged. Consumers are concerned about the environment and animal welfare. As a result, two choices are rising in popularity: plant-based meats and cultured meats. The meat alternatives market is estimated to reach $140bn (£104bn) within the next decade. That’s about 10% of the $1.4tn global meat industry.

Plant-based foods’ emissions are 10 to 50 times smaller than those from animal products. Cultured (lab-grown) meats generate up to 96% fewer emissions, use up to 96% less water, and require 99% less land than traditionally farmed meats. And no animals need to be slaughtered in the process.

World’s 1st Commercial Cultured Meat Production Facility

According to the Straits Times (ST), Esco Aster, a home-grown contract development and manufacturing organization, has already begun operations at its commercial facility in Singapore. The facility, located in the 8-story Ayer Rajah Crescent, produces chicken products via cell culture instead of slaughter. On July 28, it was given SFA approval and began making cell-cultured chicken – a world first.

Esco Aster’s facility paves the way for more protein alternatives to enter the Singapore market and enhance the nation’s food security. In December last year, the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) was the world’s first regulatory authority to approve the sale of cultured meat – chicken nuggets from Eat Just – after it was deemed safe for consumption.

On April 22 (Earth Day), Eat Just joined forces with Foodpanda, Asia’s leading food, and grocery delivery platform, to launch the world’s first home delivery of cell-cultured meat. Diners were able to place orders of three GOOD Meat Cultured Chicken dishes via the Foodpanda app, with each order boxed in sustainable bamboo packaging and delivered by e-bike. In addition, eat Just’s Good Meat cultivated chicken is now available via the delivery platform from the Cantonese restaurant Madame Fan at JW Marriott Singapore South Beach.

Before this SFA approval to produce cultured chicken for commercial use, Eat Just’s cultured chicken nuggets were not allowed to be manufactured in Singapore. However, a spokesman for SFA noted: “This is the same cultured chicken which was previously approved by SFA in 2020.”

Cultured meat is meat products made from growing animal cells in a bioreactor – like the tanks used in brewing beer – instead of slaughtering real-life chickens. This method is considered a more sustainable approach to producing meat since large volumes can be made using less land and labor.

Esco Aster, a subsidiary of the Esco Lifescience Group, has supplied tools and technology, including bioreactors, to companies in the alternative proteins industry. The firm also offers manufacturing services for vaccine development and cell- or gene therapy, among others. Esco Aster’s chief executive Lin Xiangliang told ST on September 15 that, thanks to this professional background, Esco Aster designed the manufacturing facility to the standards required by SFA.

In Singapore, company’s who wish to produce cultured meat products must first conduct and submit safety assessments of the products for SFA’s review before they’re allowed to sell them. These assessments comprise potential food safety risks, such as toxicity and production method safety. In addition, companies must also provide detailed information on the materials used in the manufacturing processes and how these are regulated to prevent food safety risks. Finally, firms that plan to manufacture these approved products in Singapore must obtain a separate SFA license.

The SFA spokesman explained:

If companies wish to manufacture any already-approved alternative protein products in Singapore, as with any other food, they must obtain an SFA license and are subject to checks by SFA of the premises, systems, and products. SFA will also inspect and sample the product for testing, just as we do for other imported and locally manufactured food products.

The only cultured meat product approved for sale in Singapore is Eat Just’s cultured chicken bites. “We have multiple production partners for Good Meat and look forward to growing our business in Singapore, which will be a manufacturing hub for the company,” added a spokesman for Eat Just.

According to the Eat Just spokesman, regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions, such as the Middle East and the United States, are assessing Eat Just’s Good Meat cultivated chicken. Eventually, the firm plans to set up a cultivated meat facility in the Middle East and Northern Africa.

Path To Commercialization

According to the FAO, alternative proteins are gaining interest globally as an increasing number of consumers become conscious about the massive carbon footprint of nurturing livestock for food, which produces roughly 15% of global GHG emissions.

While this is an emerging field, with Singapore the only country approved to sell such products, many cultured meat consumer goods are already being made in smaller facilities and laboratories at a smaller scale. However, a commercial plant in Singapore could enable the production of such alternative proteins to be scaled up more rapidly once they’re approved for sale, bringing costs down.

Mirte Gosker, the acting managing director at The Good Food Institute Asia Pacific – a non-profit that champions meat alternatives, highlighted:

This move is the clearest sign yet that the Lion City is all in on scaling up alternative proteins and driving Asia’s runaway lead in food technology. Other nations would be wise to follow Singapore’s example by investing in this smarter way of making meat before they get left behind.

Around 20 companies producing lab-grown meat and plant-based protein have set up bases in Singapore over the last couple of years.

The country currently imports over 90% of its food from more than 160 countries, and the pandemic has affected vital global supply chains. However, the government aims to have 30% of Singapore’s nutrition from domestic sources by 2030.

Singapore is the first country to develop a regulatory framework to bring cultured meat to the market. In May, the Future Ready Food Safety Hub opened to help companies navigate the approval process to accelerate their products onto consumers’ plates.

The city-island-nation with almost no livestock and hardly any agricultural land hopes to become a meat producer eventually. “Singapore provides a path to commercialization. It is the only place in the world where that’s possible,” commented Carrie Chan, the founder, and CEO of Avant Meats, a Hong Kong-based company developing cultured fish in Singapore.

The World’s 1st Lab-Grown Crab

The first cell-based meat firm in Singapore, Shiok Meats, has unveiled the world’s first lab-grown crab meat at a recent tasting event in Singapore. Shiok Meats creates authentic seafood from a small number of animal cells in a laboratory, a technique used to produce food without relying on industrial fishing.

Dr. Ka Yi Ling and Dr. Sandhya Sriram, the Co-founders of Shiok, said in a joint statement:

We are ecstatic that we were able to showcase the first-ever cell-based crab meat that we produced in our facility. We are humbled by the support and enthusiasm of our team, investors, and collaborators. In this exclusive tasting event, we invited some key stakeholders in the food and alternative protein industry.

For the event, at Kebaya, an eclectic restaurant in Bukit Timah, Shiok Meats partnered with local chef José Luis Del Amo to prepare several dishes highlighting the company’s innovative cell-based crab.

Two of these dishes mixed Shiok’s cell-based crab with other innovative products to create:

Crab Cake (a blend of Shiok’s cell-based crab and vegan OmniPork).

Chili Crab (which contains Shiok’s crab powder served with mantou buns).

Chef Del Amo said:

The ingredient is really versatile, and it works well across different cuisines, including local Asian dishes. Also, it’s fantastic that we can now prepare delicious meals with sustainable crab meat.

Now that Shiok has championed the flavor of crab, it’s working on perfecting the texture of the crustacean by introducing scaffolding during the growth process. The company is also exploring how it could lower the production costs of making seafood via this method and aims to commercialize its crab meat by 2023.

Shiok’s road to market will be cleared by regulatory hurdles it would likely face in other countries, now that Singapore has been granted regulatory approval to cell-based meat when it approved the sale of Eat Just’s GOOD Meat Cultured Chicken.

Before revealing its cell-based crab to the public, Shiok produced meat from other crustaceans using its cell-based technology. Shiok unveiled its cell-based shrimp served in Tom Yum Soup and its cell-based lobster in Lobster Potato Chips during the latest tasting event.

The company uses proprietary technology to isolate stem cells from shrimp, crab, and lobster to produce the meat. Then, the harvested cells are grown in a nutrient-rich environment (like a greenhouse), and after 4 to 6 weeks, the result is real crustacean meat.

This new way of producing seafood meat solves the increasing global demand for traditionally caught seafood. Unfortunately, the global industrial fishing industry destroys marine ecosystems and wreaks havoc on the environment. Meanwhile, the crustacean industry is responsible for 22% of fishing-related GHG emissions, despite making up only 6% of global catch landings.

Dr. Sriram and Dr. Yi Lin explained:

Our mission is to develop cell-based crustacean meats that are contributing towards a cleaner and healthier seafood industry and solving for the inefficiencies around global protein production. We are working very hard on making sure that our products are delicious, healthy, and affordable in the long run.

Besides reducing emissions and preventing overfishing, one of the many benefits of growing seafood from cells as opposed to catching it, is that the process can be carried out in landlocked areas.

Major Obstacles

However, two significant obstacles are standing in the way of Singapore’s dreams of “animal-free meat” self-sufficiency. The first is cost. For example, Shiok Meats’ “shrimp” paste costs the company about US$5,000 to produce one kilogram of the paste, far from commercially viable.

In addition, most lab-grown cells are nourished with a growth medium, often fetal bovine serum (FBS), extracted from aborted calves. FBS is used widely in the biotech industry; its production is highly regulated worldwide. However, its supply is limited, and its cost is outrageous: 500 milliliters costs approximately US$500.

Most importantly, an industry based on producing meat without animal suffering should not include ingredients from slaughterhouses. But that’s precisely where FBS comes from.

When a cow arriving for slaughter is pregnant, that cow is slaughtered and bled; then, the fetus is removed and brought into a blood collection room. The fetus, kept alive during the following procedure to ensure blood quality, has a needle jabbed into its heart. Next, its blood is drained, which usually takes around five minutes until the fetus dies. This blood is subsequently refined, and the resulting extract is FBS. Millions of fetuses are slaughtered this way. FAO estimated that the percentage of slaughtered pregnant dairy cows is between 17 and 31%.

There are alternatives to FBS —People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has compiled a list of 74 potential cell culture alternatives, but almost all are cell-type specific. In contrast, FBS is a universal growth medium, meaning you can take nearly any cell type, throw it into a petri dish with FBS, and the cells will grow.

The second big question for the city-island-nation is whether domestic production will reduce its reliance on foreign supply. Substances like FBS are imported, as are the ingredients needed for Singapore’s booming plant-based protein market.

Animal-Free Protein

On April 26, Bühler, a global leader for food processing solutions, and Givaudan, a leading global company in Taste and Wellbeing, opened a new Protein Innovation Center in Singapore. It serves as an R&D facility for plant-based protein companies that want to produce new recipes and learn how to industrialize them. However, yet again, most ingredients need to be shipped into the country.

One potential solution to Singapore’s reliance on foreign ingredients is food waste. There are already companies making vegan meat, dairy, and protein from food waste. Another way to make protein in a factory is via fermentation. Usually, the fungus or microbes that produce such protein would be fed with imported glucose; however, scientists are exploring whether they are partial to old yeast from Singapore’s breweries or coffee grounds from its cafes.

The future of Singapore’s blossoming protein industry may be a mix of animal cells and vegetables. “The trend we see right now is a mix of cultured meat and plant-based protein. Full cultured meat in the market is far away, but animal proteins help enhance the texture of plant-based products,” explained Adrien Beauvisage, Buhler’s president for Southeast Asia."

Breaking News on the Digital Switchover

Date Reset for Digital Switchover

The industry are now working to a date of January 2027 to safely move the remaining customers off the PSTN network. For BT customers, that will mean either moving to Digital Voice, or the newly announced Dedicated Landline Service for those customers that don’t have Broadband.

Read press release here.

Letter from Openreach 16/05/2024

You may have heard of BT Group’s announcement this morning, around their intention to reset the date for the switching off of the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). The original date we’ve all been working towards was December 2025. BT Group announced today the reset of this date to 31 January 2027.

Our copper product ‘Wholesale Line Rental’ (WLR) relies on the PSTN to work and we planned to withdraw this product in December 2025 in line with the PSTN switch-off. Openreach will realign the withdrawal of WLR date to 31 January 2027. This additional 13 months allows more time for Communications Providers (CPs) to safely migrate their vulnerable customers off of the PSTN.

How does this change affect CPs (also known as Service Providers, like Sky, TalkTalk, BT etc)

Our message to CPs is to continue migrating at pace (where it is safe to do so).

CPs now have more time to identify and safely migrate their vulnerable customers, but we encourage them to do this as soon as they can.

We will continue to work with CPs on complex migration scenarios.

What does this mean for you?

You should by now have an inventory of all your lines and associated Service Provider(s). If you’re not already talking to your Service Provider, please make plans to do so ASAP.



Please continue to audit any devices on your estate, whether that’s a lift alarm, monitoring service or telecare device. Reach out to your device suppliers and get help and advice on the compatibility of these devices on a digital network.

The urgency for switching customers onto digital services grows by the day because the 40-year-old analogue landline technology is becoming increasingly fragile and harder to maintain service. We encourage you to continue with your current plans to switch to digital as soon as possible.

What about the vulnerable?

We’ve been working closely with CPs to develop a new ‘Prove Telecare’ service which would help to ensure that telecare devices still work after an engineering visit to upgrade an end customer to a digital service. This service will be trialled later this year.

BT Business plan to launch a new service (available until 2030) called ‘Pre-digital Phone Line’. BT Business are inviting CPs to register their interest to become resellers of this service to their customers. This service will give end customers an analogue type of voice service, with power on the line via their master socket. This is a temporary solution rather than a long-term alternative to digital.

In December 2023, many CPs signed a UK Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) PSTN Charter to protect vulnerable customers. And, in January 2024, we signed a complimentary Network Operator Charter. This led to several CPs pausing their non-voluntary migrations to make adjustments to their processes. This includes further work to identify vulnerable their customers.

We’ve updated our FAQs regarding the PSTN switch-off reset, in the first instance please check here if you have any questions

Important briefing from BT about incorrectly connected telecare equipment. Please read.

Incorrect use of BT Digital Voice Adapters with Telecare equipment.

This briefing is for providers and installers of dispersed analogue telecare equipment that connects over residential telephone lines provided by BT or EE.

Healthcare alarms or medical pendants MUST NOT be plugged into a BT Digital Voice Adaptor.

Compatible* analogue telecare alarms should only be plugged into the green phone port located on the back of the BT Smart hub broadband router provided to BT Digital Voice customers.

Customers migrating to BT Digital Voice may be provided with one or more BT Digital Voice Adapters. These allow existing telephone handsets to continue to be used where they are in located away from the BT Smart hub.

The BT Digital Voice Adapter has not been tested for use with telecare alarms and will not work in the event of a power cut. The adapter is designed for use with telephone equipment only.

Other phone providers may also refer to ‘adapters’ but these should not be confused with the BT Digital Voice adapter.

*Compatible analogue telecare equipment confirmed to work with BT Digital Voice is determined by the individual telecare service provider.

I was suffering from extreme breathlessness. Walking from the bathroom to another room left me exhausted to the point that I was gasping for air. I was sleeping continuously. There were many days when I slept for 18 hours, yet when I woke up, I felt exhausted like I hadn’t slept at all. My body felt heavy. Every muscle ached.



I started to suffer with cardiac symptoms. I previously had a resting pulse of 55bpm. Now, my heart would start to race for no reason, reaching 140bpm or higher, and flutter. This was accompanied by severe and sudden central chest pain that would strike at any time and literally leave me breathless.



I was off work from April 2020 until the end of October that year. I had no energy. I was referred to Occupational Health and had telephone consultations with them. I was breathless even talking. They were very supportive and did follow-ups with me.

I get fatigued so easily. One short shift floored me for days

I was also given appointments with a clinical psychologist, as were my colleagues. I had a few sessions on the phone but although it was good to talk about it, the whole COVID experience on a personal and work level was just too traumatic. I know I can self-refer if I feel I need further sessions.



My GP was very supportive too. All consultations and prescriptions were over the phone due to ongoing COVID restrictions, but they helped arrange cardiac and respiratory investigations.



Occupational Health recommended a phased return to work over a month. I then used annual leave to reduce my hours for another month. I really needed that, as I get fatigued so easily. One short shift floored me for days. My colleagues have been supportive – a few of them are also experiencing long COVID, so it’s good to be able to speak to people who understand.



Alongside the fatigue, I developed other issues with sleep. Although I was sleeping for excessively long periods, I would have night terrors and wake up with my body paralysed. Sleeping remains an issue for me. I’ve had a 24-hour tape and multiple other respiratory investigations to start trying to find out why this is happening.

Trying to stay positive

Fast-forward to September 2021 and I am working full time again, but unable to do nights as I remain easily fatigued. On my days off I sleep for 12-18 hours just to catch up. I still have vivid, terrifying dreams. Before COVID, I’d only ever needed five hours sleep each night to feel refreshed. My brain still feels foggy and every muscle in my body aches for no reason. Sometimes, I’ll be in work having a conversation and my mind goes blank. It is embarrassing.



In the past few weeks, more than a year on from my initial infection, I was finally able to return to the gym. I can only manage very short periods. My previously low and steady heart rate goes through the roof. I am startled easily and get sudden central chest pain when this happens.



Breathlessness remains an issue. My lungs feel like they are heavy and full of sand. I have a cough which comes and goes.

I’m a shell of the person I was, but I am focusing hard on being positive

Life has changed hugely. I have gained four stone as I’ve been unable to train. Whereas I used to run half marathons, now I can barely muster the energy to get up most days. But I am grateful for the small improvements I’m making, finally getting back to the gym to try to rebuild myself.



My symptoms come and go and that is the difficult bit. I recently had to take two weeks off work because my heart rate dropped to the low 40s and I could barely keep my eyes open.



When the pandemic began, I wasn’t afraid of getting COVID as I knew I was extremely fit. It still shocks me that I feel so exhausted now. COVID has been life-changing and I’m a shell of the person I was, but I am focusing hard on being positive."

164814,https://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Covid-19-and-the-art-and-science-of-data-visualisation/,Article concerning the use of data visualisations during the Covid-19 pandemic.,True,Covid-19 and the art and science of data visualisation,"The Covid-19 pandemic has seen political leaders and civil servants using data visualisation to describe the situation and justify their decisions.
That is why those using it, including those in government, have to know its limitations, according to Rob Fry, ONS head of data visualisation.
“Knowing that number could be higher or could be lower could affect the decision.”Fry runs a small team supporting data visualisation work at ONS.
The data visualisation team works directly on high-profile releases, including the Covid-19 infection survey, as well as providing training and guidance.
“I do think that some data visualisation creators don’t consider enough how their Covid-19 visualisation looks to people who have lost somebody to this disease, or who have it themselves,” says Rost.","numbers, map, using, science, charts, visualisation, graph, england, art, visualisations, data, covid19","The Covid-19 pandemic has seen political leaders and civil servants using data visualisation to describe the situation and justify their decisions. But it has also demonstrated that while software makes it easy to turn numbers into pictures, it requires skilled humans to do this well.

At a much-delayed press conference held at 6.30pm on 31 October 2020 – its timing apparently forced by the BBC’s unwillingness to delay Strictly Come Dancing – chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance presented a graph that predicted daily deaths in England rising from about 200 to 800 by 8 December. The graph included a range of predictions, with a worst-case figure of around 1,500.

This element of the graph was mistaken and the government republished the slides with the top of the range at just over 1,000 deaths a day. This prediction was wrong as well: 375 people died in England from Covid-19 on 8 December, although this was several weeks into new lockdown restrictions. (See the “before and after” graphs below).

Prime minister Boris Johnson announced these at the Halloween press conference, immediately after Vallance and chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty had concluded their slides. “I am afraid that no responsible PM can ignore the message of those figures,” Johnson said by way of justification.

Before the specific error was discovered, the visualisations were criticised for being too detailed with tiny writing, scaring viewers rather than enlightening them. “This is a complicated slide,” Vallance said of one headed “England new SPI-M combined projection bed usage”. “Next Halloween I’m going as a graph,” tweeted Marina Hyde, a journalist at The Guardian.

The first graph published on 31 October 2020.

The revised graph published on 31 October 2020.

“We’ve seen from government press conferences that less can sometimes be more, and keeping things simple can often be the best way to communicate with data,” says Gavin Freeguard, writer of Warning: Graphic Content, an email newsletter covering data visualisation. “You wouldn’t throw letters onto a page and hope they fall into crisp sentences and perfectly formed paragraphs that tell the story you want to tell. Yet too often, people throw numbers into charts and think that’s enough. It isn’t.”

Andy Cotgreave, technical evangelism director at visualisation software provider Tableau, says the charts used in the government’s Covid-19 press conferences should be checked as carefully as any written material. “It’s their space to communicate with clarity on behaviour change to a nervous public,” he says. “The interface has to be perfect.”

One problem is the re-use of visualisations in press conferences that have been designed for civil servants and politicians who are spending much of their lives tackling the pandemic. Cotgreave says the public versions should be simpler and presenters should spend more time explaining them, with a good rule being that viewers need to be able to understand a chart in less time than it takes to make it available for them to look at. “You don’t have to dumb things down, but you have to bring your audience with you if it’s complicated,” he says.

But there are dangers in designing charts to make them more accessible. This can be down to incompetence, with a graph of new local cases apparently broadcast by Fox31, a Denver television station, using a vertical x-axis that started at 30 then went up in semi-random divisions which represented 10, 30 or 50 cases. Artificial intelligence researcher Yann LeCun dubbed this a “laugharithmic scale”.

Better-designed visualisations can still be misleading, however. Last March, open data campaigner Alice Casey criticised BBC News for a bar chart that showed the proportions of people dying from Covid-19 based on age, health condition and sex, using data on 44,000 people in China. It was clearly labelled and included the source of the data.

But its horizontal y-axis ended at 15%, with this percentage shown only once at the bottom of three graphs. As a result, the bar for 80 and above fatality rate went almost all the way across the chart. “The visualisation kind of conveyed, ‘old people die of Covid’,” says Cotgreave.

He designed an alternative version that included those who died and those who survived, which showed that the oldest were most at risk, but also reflected that six out of seven of those aged 80 and above would survive. “The way I choose to show data will influence your interpretation,” he says. “People don’t realise that.”

Andy Cotgreave’s alternative bar chart.

Concern over how users will interpret data is why the Office for National Statistics (ONS) includes ranges of error on both visualisations and commentary on its weekly Covid-19 infection survey, run with the universities of Oxford and Manchester, Public Health England and health charity the Wellcome Trust. The research is based on test kits sent to a random sample of the population and is seen as one of the best data sources on the pandemic in the UK.

That is why those using it, including those in government, have to know its limitations, according to Rob Fry, ONS head of data visualisation. “There are life-changing decisions made off the back of this data,” he says. Error bars show the range within which statisticians are 95% confident the true number lies, illustrating its accuracy, he adds. “Knowing that number could be higher or could be lower could affect the decision.”

Fry runs a small team supporting data visualisation work at ONS. For most research, analysts draft charts in Microsoft Excel and a central publishing team adapts these using JavaScript libraries, primarily from Norwegian visualisation specialist Highcharts, as well as D3.js and Mapbox GL. The data visualisation team works directly on high-profile releases, including the Covid-19 infection survey, as well as providing training and guidance.

The team advises ONS staff to think about a visualisation’s key message and design it based on that. “You’ll avoid the temptation of trying to cram too much into the chart,” says Fry. They also tell colleagues to make charts self-contained with a title and annotation that emphasises the key message, so they work when used elsewhere. The ONS website encourages such re-use by providing links to embed and download visualisations.

ONS also publishes its style guide, allowing anyone to draw on its guidance. This includes advice on colour choices, including “get it right in black and white” to make charts accessible to those who are completely colour blind, “red and green should never be seen” as more common types of colour blindness make it difficult to distinguish between them, and “the safest hue is blue”.

As well as Covid-19, Fry’s team is working on automatically generated visualisations of highly localised data from the Census that ONS is running in England and Wales on Sunday 21 March 2021, although this “Census Atlas” will not be available until next year. In the meantime, its work visualising the pandemic is being seen by millions: within two days of publication, 150 million tiles were requested from an interactive map of deaths, equivalent to about 10 million views. “It’s a very harrowing display of data, thinking of all the people and families behind those deaths,” says Fry.

Maps have been heavily used in visualising Covid-19. Berlin-based charting tool Datawrapper says maps made up 21% of all visualisations published through its system in 2020, up from 10% in 2017, although this is part of a long-term trend and line graphs also increased, from 19% in previous years to 23% in 2020.

Maps have their own challenges, such as whether to use a choropleth or heat map – where areas are coloured or shaded based on data – or symbols centred on a location, such as circles, the size of which is based on data. “What you choose depends on the question you are trying to answer for your viewers,” says Estella Geraghty, chief medical officer and health solutions director at California-based geographic software provider Esri.

A dashboard launched early in the pandemic by Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore used red circles, centred on countries and US states, with diameters reflecting case numbers, on a black and grey map. The stark design helped raise awareness, but also showed all cases equally.

This is difficult with choropleths when constituent areas vary a lot in size, with geographically tiny countries such as Singapore being near-invisible on a global scale. But it can make sense for data linked to political decisions. “If it’s a policy issue, you probably want the political boundaries,” says Geraghty. “Go back to: what am I trying to communicate?”

Choropleths have been used extensively in the UK and elsewhere to communicate Covid-19 case rates, but apparently minor choices can change what they communicate. During the Halloween press conference, Whitty used a map of case rates in England that showed much of the North and Midlands in a livid dark purple colour.

James Cheshire, a professor in geographic information and cartography at University College London, points out that the areas coloured deep purple had anything between 200 and 740 weekly cases per 100,000 people, while the first two colours covered narrow ranges of just 0 to 25 and 25 to 50.

“The choice made for this map over-emphasises small leaps in small numbers at the expense of big leaps in large numbers,” he writes. His reworking of the map with equal colour breaks based on the full range of case rates put most of England in the lightest shades, with only a few areas in the north in the most alarming colours.

James Cheshire’s reworking of the map (bottom left)

One way to make maps work better is a blended approach, publishing them with tables, bar graphs and automatically generated commentary, something Californian data analytics provider Tibco Software has done with its Covid-19 dashboard. Chief analytics officer Michael O’Connell says this counteracts problems with choropleth maps, such as data on small areas getting lost. The dashboard also uses darker colours to highlight the previous week’s data on several charts.

The need to communicate numbers on Covid-19 has meant a steep learning curve for those using charts to do so. “Most big coronavirus dashboards and visualisations have been vastly improved over time – and others have copied their ideas,” says Lisa Charlotte Rost, a designer who writes Datawrapper’s blog. “Nowadays, I very rarely see a visualisation by a newsroom of any size that makes me cringe.”

But she adds that those visualising data on the pandemic need to remember that the numbers represent people. On a set of automatically updating charts that Datawrapper has generated since last March, deaths are shown in black to reflect respect, cases are in blue and recoveries in green. “I do think that some data visualisation creators don’t consider enough how their Covid-19 visualisation looks to people who have lost somebody to this disease, or who have it themselves,” says Rost."

Pinkwashing is a relatively new term, coined by Breast Cancer Action as part of their Think Before You Pink campaign. It is used to describe an organization that claims to care about breast cancer, by promoting a pink ribbon product, but at the same time produces, manufactures and/or sells products that are linked to the disease.

A prime example would be KFC who partnered with Susan G. Komen For The Cure, to produce Buckets For The Cure, which were their usual fatty fried chicken in pink tubs – it seems that you can make anything appear virtuous by simply colouring it pink and slapping a ribbon on it. Breast Cancer Action (BCA) described the distasteful gimmick as “feeding people carcinogenic grilled chicken that raises the risk of … breast cancer”. But, you could argue that KFC donated over $4million dollars to the charity and raised awareness for a killer disease in low-income neighbourhoods as a result of the campaign, so what’s the problem? Here’s a look at both sides of the pinkwashing coin.

Raising awareness

Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in the UK, counting for almost a third of new cancer cases in women, and the lifetime risk of a woman in the UK developing the disease is one in eight. Over 50,000 people are diagnosed with breast cancer in the UK each year, but 90% of women diagnosed in the earliest stage survive the disease for more than five years. With these powerful facts, it is no wonder that so many people believe that all awareness is good, no matter what the underlying motive; the more people who regularly check their breasts, the greater the chance of early-stage diagnosis, therefore the greater number of people beating breast cancer.

Commercialising emotion

But as the global breast cancer awareness business has become a multibillion dollar runaway train, other people are getting upset that plenty of organisations are just cashing in on the power of pink to boost sales. Changing the shade of the packaging for one month of the year is big business: research by Cone Communications in America showed that, all things being equal, 79% of consumers would be likely to switch brand allegiance for a good cause. Companies know that the product is virtually irrelevant and that the public are only really buying goodwill under a false sense of activism.

More sales, less donations

While all pink products experience a surge in sales, many companies unashamedly increase prices; the uplift in prices and profits, plus ongoing brand loyalty, more than makes up for the amount “generously” donated to charity. Other companies put a cap on the amount given away, so that sales over and above that figure improve their own bottom line. Some people say that is fair enough, because at least the company is sending some money to the cause, but sadly there are plenty of companies who blatantly cash in on the power of pink without giving one penny to a breast cancer organisation.

Humble beginnings

Other cause symbols haven’t suffered this abuse – the red AIDS ribbon has kept its dignity and the poppy is still a strong sign of support for the Royal British Legion – but sadly the pink ribbon didn’t have a very auspicious start. It began life in America as a peach ribbon that Charlotte Haley handed out, to raise awareness that only five per cent of the National Cancer Institute’s $1.8 billion budget went towards cancer prevention. Women’s health magazine, Self, and Estée Lauder teamed up to ask for permission to use the ribbon as the latter’s executive, Evelyn Lauder, was a breast cancer survivor. Haley refused, on the basis that the request was too commercial, but the companies decided to cash in on the idea anyway and produced their own pink version. The rest, as they say, is history.

Fading power of pink

Where breast cancer was once a taboo issue and the ribbon was worn as a sign of solidarity, now breast cancer support is a fashion statement, with top designers creating ranges of pink ribbon clothes and celebrities attending fancy launch parties drenched in pink. While it is amazing that one little piece of coloured material has achieved so much fame, the power of pink is waning since it has been turned into a commodity. Such gimmicky pink products can be hurtful to the thousands of women living through breast cancer hell on a daily basis, and survivors of the disease can feel that their struggle has been cheapened.

It seemed that the awareness campaign for testicular cancer had learnt valuable lessons from pinkwashing as Movember couldn’t be bought – supporters had to actually grow a moustache. But, of course, you can now find moustaches emblazoned on everything. Maybe pinkwashing is not just the curse of breast cancer, but a comment on the commercialist society in which we live.

Undesirable links

While KFC’s fatty fried food is a clear non sequitur to raising awareness for breast cancer, other products might not seem so at odds with the cause. Pink perfumes and cleaning products, for example, seem harmless enough, but criticism ranges from toxic chemicals known to increase the risk of breast cancer being used in the product, to other harmful products the parent company produces, and reinforcing sexist stereotypes.

However, like KFC, some of the products that have been “pinked up” are so wrong, the executives responsible should blush. For instance, didn’t anyone see the irony of the pink grip on a Smith & Wesson gun being used as a symbol to save lives? Or the Pink Your Drink campaign run by vodka manufacturer Chambourd, when alcohol consumption is known to increase the risk of breast cancer? Even pink packaging for Jaffa Cakes and Lucozade is awkward as, although an occasional sweet treat is acceptable, the association with sugar-filled products is uncomfortable given that obesity significantly increases a person’s risk of the disease.

Think before you pink

Although it undoubtedly raises awareness, many people would prefer it if consumers and manufacturers alike just donated directly to breast cancer organisations, rather than wasting money on a pointless piece of pink packaging. BCA is fighting back against pinkwashing with a Think Before You Pink Toolkit, which helps people detach themselves from superficial awareness and provides resources to move the conversation away from fashion and back to action.

Long-term team wellbeing is about more than simply offering access to mindfulness apps or training a handful of managers. It begins with culture change – listening to your staff and implementing the right processes throughout your business to help them perform better.

Dr Chris Golby, director, Lumien – a mental health platform helping businesses to find the balance between team wellbeing and productivity – unpicks the data, explaining what’s going wrong with workplace mental health and why culture change is key.

The cost of poor workplace wellbeing

It’s estimated that poor workplace mental health is costing UK businesses an enormous £45bn each year, when taking into account absences, presenteeism costs and costs of team turnover.

Lumien data highlights that general wellbeing is impacting employees 27% of the time. When it comes to poor employee wellbeing, companies are losing 17% productivity on average (Source: Lumien). This equates to an annual cost, per employee, of £5,318.45 (based on the 2021 median UK salary).

Productivity shortfalls aren’t the only cost, with further data uncovering that half of Millennials and 75% of Gen-Z have previously left jobs for mental health reasons.

The ‘tick box trap’

Since COVID-19, many organisations are now implanting additional procedures to support workplace wellbeing, which are often centred around mental health and support for remote employees.

For a lot of these employers, this might include offering Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs), training managers in Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) or extending subscriptions to mindfulness apps across the business. In these scenarios, actions are often reactive – as a response to an employee issue or an employee facing a mental health crisis.

This brings about a ‘tick box’ mentality, where actions or support are guided by criteria laid out in mental health certifications or regulations. This leads to the ‘tick box trap’ – where organisations are heavily investing in workplace mental health, without knowledge of whether measures are what employees need or want. This investment is also often taken without setting measures or goals to evaluate whether actions are working or not.

There is no ‘one size fits all’ approach to workplace wellbeing. Being proactive is challenging – but employers need to collect data from their employees to understand what’s right for them. It’s a larger task, but it’s far more forward-thinking, progressive and effective in the long-term.

The case for culture change

In its wellbeing report, Deloitte highlighted how 1 in 4 employees fear negative consequences for formalising mental health issues in the workplace. Meanwhile, Mind’s Workplace Wellbeing Index shows how just 52% of employees will disclose workplace mental health issues to their employer.

This means that wellbeing issues can go unnoticed for extended periods of time. If you’re reliant on a reactive approach, these issues will likely worsen, which can see increased absences, reduced productivity and engagement, or can potentially even cause the employee to leave. Instead, a proactive approach gives you the insight you need to make wellbeing strategies that support every employee effectively.

Analysis of investment in employee wellbeing found that, on average, for every £1 invested:

Organisational-wide culture change and mental health awareness returns £6

Reactive support, such as therapy or treatment once issues are identified, returns only £3.

A culture-led approach to wellbeing moves beyond changing things for one employee after the fact. Instead, it’s about listening to every employee and promoting change across the organisation.

This culture-led approach isn’t about matching employees to your brand values. Instead, it’s about shaping the organisation itself around your employees, adapting your culture around your team and being flexible to their individual needs, so they can work in line with your values.

Using data to drive decisions

Employers need to create evidence-based strategies to tackle workplace wellbeing effectively. This offers insight into employees’ wants and needs, highlighting areas that could be improved. A data-led strategy demonstrates to employees that they’re being listened to, so you can support them effectively, ensuring they feel happy and healthy in their roles.

The International Commission for Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) defines non-ionizing radiation as ""electromagnetic radiation that does not carry enough photon energy to ionize atoms or molecules"".
The four-page report, titled '5G mobile technology: a guide', runs through a definition of 5G and highlights the similarities to 4G technology before it.
The UK's telecommunications regulator, Ofcom, has conducted its own spectrum tests to establish whether there is a health risk inherent to 5G technology.
ConclusionThe conclusion we can draw from the evidence above is that 5G is almost certainly safe to use.","radio, guidelines, radiation, dangerous, 5g, frequencies, technology, mobile, uk, health, safe, nonionizing","5G will provide vastly increased mobile network speeds, lower latency, greater capacity and improved coverage across the developed world.

The next-generation mobile network is expected to birth new industries and make fresh innovation possible thanks to its greater capacity and faster response times. To the average smartphone user, it will be like having constant access to an extremely fast Wi-Fi connection.

But is 5G safe? And is there a link between the rollout of 5G and the current coronavirus pandemic that's sweeping the world? That’s what some have been questioning as 5G finally commences its long anticipated rollout.

1) 5G and Covid-19

The most recent and high-profile occurrence of public concern over 5G's health impact relates to the current Covid-19 pandemic. Here in the UK, reports have emerged online linking the spread of this novel coronavirus to the uptake of 5G network technology.

This has prompted some in the UK to set fire to or otherwise vandalise 5G masts, and even to attack telecoms engineers. At a very basic level, as Ofcom's Philip Marnick explains, disabling mobile phone masts in this way is irresponsible and dangerous, because it means that ordinary people can no longer contact emergency services or their families.

Ofcom's Philip Marnick explains more about the false links being made between 5G and the coronavirus below.

But even beyond the obvious issues that such antisocial behaviour creates, there is simply no scientifically plausible link between 5G and the spread of coronavirus.

On May 6th, the UK government issued the following guidance on this topic: ""There is no evidence of a link between 5G and coronavirus. These theories have been rejected by scientific experts in the World Health Organisation and Full Fact, a UK-based independent fact checking charity.""

Over on the World Health Organization website, under a section on coronavirus myth busting, it states unequivocally that ""5G mobile networks DO NOT spread COVID-19"". It goes on to state that ""Viruses cannot travel on radio waves/mobile networks"", before pointing out that Covid-19 is spreading in many countries that do not have 5G mobile networks installed. Iran is one such prominent example.

The UK government concludes its guidance by encouraging citizens to use its SHARE Checklist tool to help spot false or misleading content. ""If you're not sure, don't share it"".

2) Why are there fears surrounding 5G’s safety?

All mobile networks, as well as wireless devices such as Wi-Fi, TV and radio transmitters, transmit radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic fields.

These are low-energy forms of radiation, and as such there have long been concerns over the possible health effects of exposure to certain RF fields.

5G brings with it renewed concern, as it will attain its vastly improved performance by accessing a very high-frequency spectrum (millimetre wave or mmWave) that has hitherto gone unexploited by mobile networks. Some have questioned whether these higher frequencies of 24GHz and above will provide an increased risk to human health.

3) Is there any scientific basis for this?

Concerns over mobile network safety aren’t new. There have been questions surrounding the effect that RF signals have on the human body, and more specifically on incidents of brain cancer, for many years. However, all major reports on the matter have concluded that there’s no discernible safety issue.

Perhaps the most extensive of these reports came from Australia in 2016. Using 30 years (the time mobile networks have been operating in the country) of comprehensive health data for the entire population, it was found that there was no correlation between mobile phone usage and incidents of brain cancer.

Here in the UK the NHS took a characteristically measured approach to that report, pointing out that while the size and quality of the data set was beyond reproach, it didn’t track individual risk patterns (such as the difference between heavy and light mobile users). Nonetheless, the NHS was still able to conclude that “when it comes to other risk factors for cancer, such as smoking, poor diet, drinking too much alcohol and lack of exercise, mobile phone ownership is probably not a significant risk to your health”.

Prior to this, in 2012, a comprehensive independent report by the Health Protection Agency concluded that there was “no convincing evidence that RF exposure below agreed international guideline levels (which the UK adheres to) causes health effects in adults or children”.

Cancer Research UK has also found no correlation between mobile phone usage and cancer in this country. It reports that mobile phone ownership in the UK increased by around 500 percent between the 1990s and 2016. The brain tumour incidence rate during that same period increased by around 34 percent, and even that increase is being attributed to better detection and reporting.

4) The key difference between non-ionizing and ionizing waves

As we’ve mentioned, the key concern with 5G is that it will eventually use a much higher intensity RF wave than the previous mobile network standards that these reports cover. However, it’s important to draw a distinction here between two very different kinds of radiation: non-ionizing and ionizing waves.

All RF fields, including those used by 5G, are forms of non-ionizing waves. The International Commission for Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) defines non-ionizing radiation as ""electromagnetic radiation that does not carry enough photon energy to ionize atoms or molecules"". This means that they don't have the power to alter the structure of a human cell.

On the flip side we have ionizing waves, which would include something like X-rays. This type of radiation does have the ability to alter human cells, which explains why they have the potential to cause cancer and other health complications.

EE points out that the ultra-violet rays we get from the sun sit right on the border between non-ionizing and ionizing radiation, yet we only tend to be concerned if we receive such rays in high dosages. UV wave frequencies are more than ten times higher than even the highest mmWave frequencies.

5) What do the UK authorities say?

5.1. What does the UK government say?

Early in 2019, an online petition called on the UK government to ‘Launch an independent enquiry into the health and safety risks of 5G’. It attracted 32,454 signatures from members of the UK public - well short of the 100,000 required to have a topic debated in Parliament.

Even so, the Department of Health and Social Care issued a 700 word response with extensive scientific references. The lead quote from this statement reads:

“Exposure to radio waves has been carefully researched and reviewed. The overall weight of evidence does not suggest devices producing exposures within current guidelines pose a risk to public health.”

In October 2019, Government agency Public Health England issued a guidance report entitled 5G technologies: radio waves and health.

In its summary, the report reads: ""It is possible that there may be a small increase in overall exposure to radio waves when 5G is added to an existing network or in a new area. However, the overall exposure is expected to remain low relative to guidelines and, as such, there should be no consequences for public health.""

The PHE has committed to monitoring the evidence and revising its advice as necessary.

In August 2020, the UK Government issued a guide to help counter bogus 5G health claims.

The four-page report, titled '5G mobile technology: a guide', runs through a definition of 5G and highlights the similarities to 4G technology before it. It also discusses the frequencies in which 5G operates, and highlights the huge gap between these and genuinely harmful ionising frequencies.

It also discusses the medical consensus that 5G is completely safe, and addresses uncertainties surrounding future millimetre wave implementation. As it turns out, mmWave frequencies have already been in use for years, and are well covered by existing safety guidelines.

5.2. What does Ofcom have to offer on the subject?

The UK's telecommunications regulator, Ofcom, has conducted its own spectrum tests to establish whether there is a health risk inherent to 5G technology. It found that emissions levels were well below international safety guidelines.

Ofcom's test took place in February 2020 across six 5G sites in 10 cities. It covered the 3.4GHz and 700MHz spectrum bands in high-traffic areas, including in and around major transport hubs and shopping centres.

The report found that ""In all cases, the measured EMF levels from 5G-enabled mobile phone base stations are at small fractions of the levels identified in the ICNIRP Guidelines (the highest level being approximately 1.5% of the relevant level)"".

It also found that ""The contribution of 5G to the total emissions level observed is currently low – the highest level we observed in the band used for 5G was just 0.039% of the reference level.""

As the report acknowledges, we're still in the early stages of 5G adoption. To that end, Ofcom states that it will ""continue to undertake EMF measurements to monitor the overall trends in the long term"", and will publish any fresh results that arise.

What does the Institution of Engineering and Technology study have to say?

The Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET) is a highly respect UK-based institution for professional engineers with a worldwide membership in excess of 168,000. Its roots go all the way back to 1871.

In its second guide, published in July 2020, the IET tackled the matter or 'Allaying health concerns regarding 5G and exposure to radio waves'.

The report makes four key observations:

1. 5G technology is very similar to 4G in terms of how it affects radio wave exposure

5G network technology has to meet the same safety standards as every mobile standard before it

No higher frequency mmWave commercial 5G mobile antennas currently exist in the UK, and none are currently planned

More base stations will mean less radio wave exposure, as it will drive down smartphone and base station power levels

IET Deputy President Professor Danielle George said: ""The conclusion that 5G is as safe as 4G, 3G and Global System for Mobile communication (GSM) is not a political soundbite, but a conclusion drawn from an objective detailed examination, by independent professional engineers, who belong to institutions committed to the very highest professional standards.""

What does the Journal of Medical Internet Research say?

The Journal of Medical Internet Research is a respected peer-reviewed medical journal established in 1999. It specifically covers matters of healthcare in the internet age.

It published a study in May 2020 titled 'COVID-19 and the 5G Conspiracy Theory: Social Network Analysis of Twitter Data', which examined how the link between Covid-19 and 5G been amplified through unreliable online forums.

The paper performed a social network analysis and content analysis of Twitter data from a 7-day period in 2020, during which time the #5GCoronavirus hashtag had been trending on Twitter in the United Kingdom.

It found that fake news websites were the most popular web source shared by adherents to 5G conspiracy theories. The paper also found that the majority of respondents (65.2%) didn't actively agree with the conspiracy theories, but that the very act of posting comments only served to amplify such erroneous views.

5.3. What do UK operators have to say?

Of course, it’s the UK’s mobile network operators that are responsible for actually implementing 5G in this country. So how do they approach the subject of 5G safety?

As both EE and Vodafone point out in their related help pages, UK operators follow the lead set by the UK government through the Health and Safety Executive and Public Health England. They in turn have adopted the international guidelines provided by the aforementioned ICNIRP, an independent organisation that provides scientific information and science-based advice on protection from non-ionizing radiations through a whole range of publications.

With regard to ICNIRP’s current stance on 5G frequencies, Vodafone points out that: “In July 2018, ICNIRP published a draft review of their mobile frequency guidelines and said that none of the frequencies used by mobile communications, including 5G, required amendments to their guidelines.”

Vodafone has also published a methodology of how it comes to a decision on the safety of its mast technology, which basically involves reading a great deal of independent scientific research. Besides ICNIRP, it also references research from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Commission’s Scientific Committee on Health, Environmental and Emerging Risks (SCHEER).

The operator has published links to a large body of international reports on the health effects of radiofrequency electromagnetic fields from these major bodies, should you wish to read further into them yourself.

It’s also worth emphasising that mmWave frequencies are not being used in the first wave of 5G’s rollout here in the UK. But as Vodafone notes, “if it was ever to be deployed in the UK, like any other service, we would still have to ensure that we complied with the international guidelines set by the ICNIRP”.

5.4 What do consumer associations have to say?

Consumer choice publication Which? Has compiled a brief YouTube video that debunks the myths surrounding 5G - including its effect on health.

In the video, Which? editor Kate Bevan outlines the crucial difference between ionizing and non-ionizing radiation. She also explains how places that have banned 5G on health grounds ""aren't necessarily connected to the evidence"".

5.5 ICNIRP guidelines

The International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection, or ICNIRP, is an international non profit scientific commission dedicated to determining exposure limits for electromagnetic fields. It released fresh guidelines on March 11, 2020.

These guidelines took seven years to develop, and specifically incorporate the higher frequencies that will be used for 5G in the future. According to ICNIRP Chairman, Dr Eric van Rongen, ""They provide protection against all scientifically substantiated adverse health effects due to EMF exposure in the 100 kHz to 300 GHz range.""

The specific changes to the report are described as 'minor', with the bulk of the recommendations much the same as they were in the previous 1998 guidelines. Indeed, in looking back those earlier guidelines were found to be ""conservative in most cases"", and to ""still provide adequate protection for current technologies"".

The additions are mainly for the future higher frequencies that will be used in 5G, and these were supplied to better protect against excessive temperature rise in the body. They include:

The addition of a restriction for exposure to the whole body

The addition of a restriction for brief (less than 6‐minute) exposures to small regions of the body

The reduction of the maximum exposure permitted over a small region of the body

""The most important thing for people to remember is that 5G technologies will not be able to cause harm when these new guidelines are adhered to,"" Dr Van Rongen said.

6. Is 5G harmful to wildlife?

There have been numerous internet reports and rumours stating that 5G causes harm to wildlife, and in particular that it is responsible for mass bird killings. These seem to stem from ill-sourced 5G conspiracy websites and social media accounts.

It's worth reiterating that 5G's non-ionizing radiation is not harmful to organic matter, which would include animals as well as humans. But could it perhaps be harmful to the magnetically sensitive navigation systems of birds?

While certain radio waves can indeed interfere with the ability of migratory birds to orient themselves, these lie much lower on the spectrum, in the AM radio frequencies. So rather than your next generation smartphone being potentially harmful to birds, it's actually more likely to be your old radio.

""Radio wave emissions above 10 MHz from radio transmission antennas (including cell telephone towers) are not known to harm birds,"" biologist Joe Kirschvink of California Institute of Technology told Audubon.

7. Conclusion

The conclusion we can draw from the evidence above is that 5G is almost certainly safe to use. We can say this because, for all the exciting new possibilities 5G presents, the core transmission technology it utilises is very similar to 4G and 3G before it.

While 5G will eventually use much higher frequencies than we’ve seen before, this ‘mmWave’ spectrum is still well within the remit of the extensive safety tests and independent reports covering the effects of RF signals that have taken place over the past several decades.

More testing will, of course, be done into the specific frequencies utilised by 5G going forward. But as of now, there’s no evidence or reason to suggest that 5G is unsafe.

Employees spend almost a third of their lives at work, so it makes sense that they would be seeking some kind of health support from their employer. A well-designed workplace wellness program is a great employee engagement tool, honouring your team’s dedication to their work, but it’s also a huge drawcard, when it comes to recruitment and your employer value proposition (EVP).

As businesses enter a post-pandemic growth phase and talent becomes harder to find, prioritising workplace wellness can help your company cut through the noise. So, how can you create one that’s memorable in all the right ways?

Well, wellness programs should reflect your unique values, while also supporting employees in the ways they need it most. Let’s take a look at the main risks to employee wellbeing right now, and which British businesses are tackling them in unique ways.

What wellbeing risks are UK employees facing right now?

It’s been a tough couple of years for British employees (care to take a guess why?).

Restrictions may have lifted around the pandemic, but uncertainty and stress still lingers. The Great Resignation is causing many employees to shift their thinking around career, and skyrocketing inflation is putting pressure on the household purse.

Our Wellness at Work report found that 54% of UK employees have felt burnt out in the last three months and 59% are stressed about their personal finances. These are just the beginning of our findings, but we think it’s safe to say – it’s not easy to be a British employee right now.

But here’s the good news. There are many ways that businesses can make a positive impact on their team’s wellbeing, all it takes is a little inspiration. Let’s have a look at six UK companies offering unique wellbeing benefits right now.

What do these companies have in common?

We know there are plenty of large corporations offering great workplace experiences, but for this list we’ve looked to smaller and less established businesses to inspire our community of SMBs.

What these innovative companies are doing – whether it be tied to mental, physical, financial, occupational or recreational wellness – is within reach, and it’s incredible to see them prioritising employee wellness along with business growth.

Another thing that these companies have in common are strong values. We believe that company values are one of the most important tools businesses of all sizes have (if you’d like to see ours, you can find them here).

Values have the power to influence decision-making, attract and retain talent, and motivate your employees. They’re the guiding principles that help inspire your team to work towards your mission and goals. Read on to discover how these businesses have incorporated their brilliant values into their employee experience to support team wellbeing.

Dishoom

Dishoom has a very special place in many Brits’ hearts, with their mouthwatering menu delighting visitors at every mealtime (here’s lookin’ at you, double bacon naan roll).

While you may know that Dishoom has delicious food, you may not be aware that they also have an incredible internal strategy to support employee wellness. Number 12 on Glassdoor’s 2022 Best Places to Work in the UK list, Dishoom has an impressive range of wellbeing perks that set the standard for hospitality businesses.

Just a couple of features of their program include; competitive industry pay and a total distribution of service charges, fully training managers in mental health first aid and supply a 24-hour confidential counselling helpline, as well as discounted memberships, classes and yoga sessions from local gyms and studios.

Although slightly outside the ‘wellness’ realm, their Bombay Bootcamp is a perk highlight. A program for staff who reach a five-year tenure with the company, as well as Head Chefs and General Managers, where participants attend a five-day immersive food tour of Bombay. Where do we apply?!

AND digital

AND digital is another feature from Glassdoor’s Best Places to Work in the UK list. This digital agency works with some of the UK’s biggest to deliver innovative tech solutions and strategies – and they apply the same unique mindset when it comes to supporting their team.

AND’s Social, Ethics and Inclusion committee operates at board level, incorporating inclusive and responsible values into their company fabric. Through their ‘Red Chair’ initiative, shares of the company are built into every contract, and every person on staff is given the opportunity to apply for the non-executive board of directors each year.

Additionally, AND provides mental health first aid training, an employee assistance program, mindfulness sessions, dedicated support communities, sustainability initiatives (they aim to be carbon neutral through offsetting by 2023 and through insetting by 2025), and much more. They’ve really got the seven dimensions of wellness covered.

Allplants

Allplants is on a mission to make sure that you get your five a day – and then some. The vegan food delivery service has health and sustainable values at the core of it’s product, so it makes a lot of sense that they extend the same ethos to their team.

Just a few of our favourite wellness support perks that they provide include; employee stock options (from day one of their team’s employment), a hybrid working model to support flexibility, a £500 yearly learning allowance, a cycle to work scheme, parental leave and pregnancy loss support leave.

They also share the goodness by giving their employees a free monthly delivery of Allplants food. Now that’s really putting your money where your team’s mouths are.

Octopus Energy

Octopus Energy is an independent energy supplier that is making green energy easily accessible and affordable in the UK. As if they aren’t doing enough in saving the planet through renewables, they also have a fantastic employee wellness scheme to boot.

Voted one of the top 5 companies in the UK for work-life balance by Glassdoor in 2020 (a notoriously unbalanced year), Octopus Energy has a people-first approach to working styles.

We especially liked their support of mental health with Headspace apps provided on a company licence, access to an ‘Octopus Money Coach’ who helps team members with financial wellbeing, and access to tax free childcare, maternity and paternity pay. They even established OctoKidsTV during the Covid lockdowns to help keep employees’ children entertained. Providing extra considerations for parental wellbeing? We love to see it.

Of course, being a renewable energy company, their perks package is inspired by sustainable living. Employees can enter a workplace salary sacrifice scheme to support the purchase of an electric vehicle, and also participate in a Cycle to Work Scheme which finances employee bikes.

Fiit

Fiit is a fitness app designed to make exercise accessible for people of all athletic levels. Classes can be done on-demand, and cover exercise styles from HIIT to strength, stretching, pilates, breathwork and more.

Fiit’s mission is to make exercise a habit for everyone, and that’s definitely reflected within their wellness program. Along with private health and dental insurance, employees enjoy a personal health and wellness budget, unlimited healthy snacks and weekly team workouts. We also appreciate the activewear-friendly office; give us comfort over corporate any day.

While they are excelling when it comes to physical health support, Fiit also does a great job at supporting occupational health. Their publicly available culture handbook goes to great lengths to understand the why of their mission; from covering the history of the home workout through to uncovering their values and how team members embody them.

Butternut Box

From food to plants to sustainability to fitness, the businesses we’ve featured so far show how a company’s mission and employee wellness program can complement each other beautifully. However, these missions and programs are slightly lacking in cute-factor.

The same cannot be said for Butternut Box, a company that delivers healthy food for your four-legged friend. Butternut Box love DOGS so much that their entire set of values is. Their values are;

Dedicated and determined

Open and honest

Genuine care

Strive for better

How is this reflected in their employee wellness program? Firstly, they have a dog-friendly office, with plenty of pooches to keep morale high. They also provide free Butternut for staff dogs – showing a little love for fur-baby wellness too.

They also offer flexible working, free counselling, a yearly development budget, pension support and a cycle to work scheme.

The Safety of COVID-19 Vaccinations - We Should Rethink the Policy

Abstract

Background: COVID-19 vaccines have had expedited reviews without sufficient safety data. We wanted to compare risks and benefits. Method: We calculated the number needed to vaccinate (NNTV) from a large Israeli field study to prevent one death. We accessed the Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR) database of the European Medicines Agency and of the Dutch National Register (lareb.nl) to extract the number of cases reporting severe side effects and the number of cases with fatal side effects. Result: The NNTV is between 200–700 to prevent one case of COVID-19 for the mRNA vaccine marketed by Pfizer, while the NNTV to prevent one death is between 9000 and 50,000 (95% confidence interval), with 16,000 as a point estimate. The number of cases experiencing adverse reactions has been reported to be 700 per 100,000 vaccinations. Currently, we see 16 serious side effects per 100,000 vaccinations, and the number of fatal side effects is at 4.11/100,000 vaccinations. For three deaths prevented by vaccination we have to accept two inflicted by vaccination. Conclusions: This lack of clear benefit should cause governments to rethink their vaccination policy.

'...The MHRA now has more than enough evidence on the Yellow Card system to declare the COVID-19 vaccines unsafe for use in humans....'

9 June 2021

OPEN LETTER TO DR RAINE, THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE MHRA FROM DR TESS LAURIE (Director, Evidence-based Medicine Consultancy Ltd and EbMC Squared CiC Bath, UK)

'...We are sharing this preliminary report due to the urgent need to communicate information that should lead to cessation of the vaccination roll out while a full investigation is conducted....'

'...The MHRA now has more than enough evidence on the Yellow Card system to declare the COVID-19 vaccines unsafe for use in humans. Preparation should be made to scale up humanitarian efforts to assist those harmed by the COVID-19 vaccines and to anticipate and ameliorate medium to longer term effects. As the mechanism for harms from the vaccines appears to be similar to COVID-19 itself, this includes engaging with numerous international doctors and scientists with expertise in successfully treating COVID-19.

There are at least 3 urgent questions that need to be answered by the MHRA:

1 How many people have died within 28 days of vaccination?

2 How many people have been hospitalised within 28 days of vaccination?

3 How many people have been disabled by the vaccination?

EbMC Squared CiC remains at your service to assist with further analysis. We kindly request full access to the Yellow Card database with immediate effect to enable a comprehensive, independent and accurate evaluation of the Yellow Card data, which will be undertaken in collaboration with clinical experts…'

Should Government mandate COVID-19 vaccines?

February 2021.

The following questions (in red type), or very similar, have been posed to JABS since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic back in March 2020.

To respond to these questions it has been necessary to provide some examples of the current technical issues and concerns as well as scientific, medical and legal opinions from here and abroad which may offer the reader of these limited notes a starting point to conduct their own research.

What do you think are the main reasons for vaccine hesitancy or refusal of the currently available Coronavirus vaccines?

Vaccines are a complex mixture of biological and reactive chemicals that are injected into adults and children. Injection allows the ingredients to bypass the natural portals of entry and the normal protective filters such as the lungs, digestive organs and the skin. This method of delivery permits the ingredients contained in vaccines to enter the bloodstream and cross the blood-brain barrier.

I believe the general public, through their own research, are now becoming aware that vaccines contain known neurotoxins like aluminium, chemically and genetically altered viruses, antibiotics, preservatives, detergents, stabilisers, neutralisers, carrying agents, Polysorbate 80, PEG, MSG, formaldehyde, glyphosate and other potentially harmful ingredients.

Of growing concern for the public is the lack of science when vaccines have not been tested for carcinogenicity – the ability to cause cancer; toxicity – the degree to which a substance can damage an organism; genotoxicity – the ability to damage genetic information; mutagenicity – ability to change the genetic material; the impact on fertility, or for long-term adverse reactions.

America’s Frontline Doctors White Paper On Experimental Vaccines For COVID-19

“…This document represents the preliminary findings of an investigation conducted by the member-physicians of America's Frontline Doctors.

We are recommending caution for patients and policy makers and employers. Additional transparency and more research are needed before we ask Americans to embark on the largest experimental medical program in US history. The unknowns must be addressed through a scientifically rigorous process.

Mandates for experimental medical therapies are neither permissible nor advisable. Ordinary Americans should not be compelled to sign up for a ""vaccine passport"" or similar mandate just to travel on an airplane or see a concert with friends. The potential for third-party abuse of private health information and real medical risk to individuals remains much too high. Concentrations of private power pose a threat to privacy and other civil liberties and policy makers must proceed with caution…”

Alliance for Natural Health write:

https://www.anhinternational.org/news/anh-feature-searching-for-answers-in-the-brave-new-world-of-covid-vaccines/#user-heading-1

“…Many people have become familiar with 3 vaccines, all based on novel, ‘next generation’, rather than ‘classical’, platforms. Two of them are messenger RNA (mRNA) based, one by Pfizer/BioNTech, the other from Moderna. These contain a synthetic sequence of messenger RNA that is concealed within novel lipid nanoparticle delivery systems that, after entering the ribosomes (that house the transcription machinery of the cells) of the muscle cells into which the vaccine is injected then instruct the muscle cells to produce a copy of the spike protein of the virus. In essence, it means that the human body becomes the vaccine factory and there is no longer a need to grow the virus on hens’ eggs, the current production system still widely used for many more classical vaccines like the seasonal flu vaccine.

The third frontrunner is the Non-Replicating Viral Vector vaccine by the AstraZeneca/Oxford University group, using a genetically modified (non-replicating) chimpanzee common cold Trojan horse into which is inserted a synthetic sequence of spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

However, according to the World Health Organization’s Draft landscape of COVID-19 candidate vaccines there are currently 64 candidate vaccines in clinical development with a further 173 in pre-clinical development, these relying on 8 different vaccine platforms in addition to the two already relied on by the 3 frontrunners. Most (31%) rely on the more conventional protein subunit platform that has been widely used for seasonal influenza vaccines…

…There has been no public debate on the ethics around introducing synthetic genetic material directly into humans by injection, bypassing the human gut, that, during our evolution, has been the primary interface with the capacity to determine what molecules, organisms or viruses are friend or foe, a task that is performed admirably by a coalition of commensal human and microbial cells (our microbiome).

Democracy has been suspended as the world is held for months on end in an emergency state, supported by the World Health Organization’s continued declaration of pandemic status. Selective reporting by the media and censorship of social media have obfuscated any possibility of scientific and public discourse. Any discourse that has occurred has been easily disregarded by the establishment as pseudoscience or conspiracy theory. This doesn’t bode well for an open or transparent world in which diverse views and ideas are shared with the hope of reaching consensus. It is divisive and polarising.

There has been grossly inadequate research on the effects of the nanomaterial delivery systems being used in the mRNA vaccines. It is quite extraordinary, and certainly disproportionate, that any food or supplement manufacturer that wants to deliver nano-sized (sub 100 nm diameter) particles via the oral route, has to go through extensive and onerous testing to verify the safety of their nano-sized particles, even if they are chemically identical to their non-nano counterparts. Yet foods are inherently many times safer than drugs and are not administered directly to the circulation like injected vaccines. So how did the vaccine makers manage to fast-track the onerous process of proving safety of their nanomaterial delivery system for their synthetic mRNA when so much is asked of food manufacturers and all of the opinions and decisions by regulators are placed in the public domain? Is it anything to do with that well-known revolving door?...""

In a recent article in the Defender (Children’s Health Defence)

https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/moderna-pfizer-vaccines-blood-clots-brain-inflammation-heart-attacks/?utm_source=salsa&eType=EmailBlastContent&eId=d0370599-722d-4ba7-bc5a-2f799066cda0

Could Spike Protein in Moderna, Pfizer Vaccines Cause Blood Clots, Brain Inflammation and Heart Attacks?

Dr. J. Patrick Whelan, a pediatric rheumatologist, warned the FDA in December that mRNA vaccines could cause microvascular injury to the brain, heart, liver and kidneys in ways not assessed in safety trials.

“…In his public submission, Whelan sought to alert the FDA about the potential for vaccines designed to create immunity to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to instead cause injuries.

Specifically, Whelan was concerned that the new mRNA vaccine technology utilized by Pfizer and Moderna has “the potential to cause microvascular injury (inflammation and small blood clots called microthrombi) to the brain, heart, liver and kidneys in ways that were not assessed in the safety trials.”

While Whelan did not dispute the vaccines’ potential to quickly arrest the spread of the virus (assuming that the vaccines prove to actually prevent transmission — also not assessed in the clinical trials), he cautioned that “it would be vastly worse if hundreds of millions of people were to suffer long-lasting or even permanent damage to their brain or heart microvasculature as a result of failing to appreciate in the short-term an unintended effect of full-length spike protein-based vaccines on other organs.”…

…Worryingly, several studies have found that the spike proteins alone have the capacity to cause widespread injury throughout the body, without any evidence of virus.

What makes this finding so disturbing is that the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines manufactured by Moderna and Pfizer and currently being administered throughout the U.S. [also in the UK] programs our cells to manufacture this same coronavirus spike protein as a way to trigger our bodies to produce antibodies to the virus.

According to Whelan’s letter to the FDA, the “Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is composed of an mRNA that produces a membrane-anchored full-length spike protein.”

A landmark study in Nature Neuroscience, published a few days after Whelan’s letter, found that the commercially obtained COVID-19 spike protein (S1) injected into mice readily crossed the blood-brain barrier, was found in all 11 brain regions examined and entered the parenchymal brain space (the functional tissue in the brain).

The researchers acknowledged that such widespread entry into the brain could explain the diverse neurological effects of S1 such as encephalitis, respiratory difficulties and anosmia (the loss of smell). The injected spike protein was also found in the lung, spleen, kidney and liver of the mice.

A second study published in December, 2020, in Neurobiology of Disease reported that the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins showed a direct negative impact on endothelial cells and provide “plausible explanations” for the neurological consequences observed in patients with COVID-19.

The researchers demonstrated that the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a known binding target for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, is “ubiquitously expressed throughout various vessel calibers in the frontal cortex.”

In another investigation, researchers studying brain tissues from 13 fatal COVID-19 cases found pseudovirions (spike, envelope and membrane proteins without viral RNA) present in the endothelia of microvessels of all 13 brains. They concluded that ACE2+ endothelial damage is a central part of SARS-CoV-2 pathology and may be induced by the spike protein alone. Injection of the full-length S1 spike subunit in the tail vein of mice, as part of the same study, led to neurologic signs (increased thirst, stressed behavior)…”





2. What could be done to address these concerns?

Pre-licensure testing: Generally, all drugs licensed by the MHRA undergo long-term double-blind pre-licensure clinical trials during which the rate of adverse reactions in the group receiving the drug under review is compared to the rate of adverse reactions in a group receiving an inert placebo, such as a sugar pill or saline injection.

In contrast, vaccines in general are not required to undergo long-term double-blind inert-placebo controlled trials to assess safety. Further, most vaccines currently in use in the UK have been approved based on studies with inadequate follow-up periods of only a few days, weeks or months. The real vaccine trials begin when the vaccines are rolled out over the population. This is the case with the experimental COVID-19 vaccines.





3. Do you think reluctance to be vaccinated may change over time once vaccines have been used for longer periods in the population, and if found effective and safe?

Post licensure surveillance: The lack of long-term comprehensive pre-licensure safety data leaves the assessment of vaccine safety to the post-licensing period when they are being administered to the public on a routine basis. In theory the system should work to flag up all serious problems with these experimental products - the guidelines advise that all suspected reactions should be reported.

In the past the passive surveillance system has been largely ineffective in reporting the serious suspected side effects of vaccinations, estimated to be between 2 and 10 percent in the UK and as little as 1% in the US.

It should be a legal requirement for all suspected vaccine adverse reactions, not just COVID vaccine reactions, to be reported instead of medical professionals making their own on-the-spot judgement, this would help to avoid the problems of under-reporting. Currently medical practices and organisations may well be conflicted by the financial entitlements paid to doctors and medics for vaccinating those registered with the practice/organisation. This type of target based payment system may contribute to the high level of under-reporting of yellow cards.

All reported suspected adverse reactions should be routinely followed-up by the MHRA making contact with the patient’s doctor to ensure the individual has fully recovered or to assess the situation further. This could provide invaluable information and help to clarify which vaccines might cause harm and to whom, potentially avoiding future injuries and deaths.

There is also the concern that COVID vaccine might contribute to ‘pathogenic priming’. According to Alliance for Natural Health:

“…’Pathogenic priming’ is a term that is more scientifically described as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of disease. In short form, it means that after infection or vaccination, a person can experience more serious, enhanced disease after being exposed to the pathogen to which they have either become immune, or that the vaccine was intended to protect against. When the enhancement is specifically related to a vaccine, it’s often called vaccine-associated hypersensitivity (VAH).

It’s an unsettling reality because it’s caused by the antibodies that normally do a great job in quelling the pathogen. It doesn’t occur in the case of most viruses (or vaccines), but has been found to occur in the case of 40 viruses. Among these are dengue viruses and coronaviruses, including SARS and MERS. The mechanisms by which it occurs are both varied and complex, but central is either an enhancement of viral entry and subsequent inactivation of innate immune cells, and/or the enhancement of infection via a key receptor on immune cells known as the Fcγ receptor (FcγR) to which Fc portions on antibodies bind. Five different mechanisms causing this to happen have been identified so far.

VAH or ADE is one reason why dengue vaccines as well as those for SARS and MERS, the latter being caused by coronaviruses, haven’t made it commercially. They were just too dangerous, no longer necessary (because SARS and MERS had waned naturally) or they were too late in being delivered. There was no Operation Warp Speed for SARS and MERS.

There should be genuine concern over the risk of VAH/ADE with covid vaccines, yet the results from Phase 3 trials that triggered emergency authorisation around the world are not sufficient to properly evaluate its risk. The fact that only hundreds (not tens of thousands) of people for each vaccine who have been vaccinated have also been exposed to wild SARS-CoV-2 is not sufficient to know if particular sub-groups of people could be susceptible to disease enhancement following exposure to the virus.

Nowhere near enough time has elapsed either. The Phase 3 trial results are only enough to know that VAH/ADE isn’t going to affect the majority and that’s at least something. But those in the community who are currently being vaccinated with the experimental vaccines are in essence the ‘guinea pigs’, and the existence or the extent of the problem will not be known until many of those vaccinated have already been exposed to the virus. That’s months and years away…”





4. Rights to employment, education, travel and social life could potentially be restricted for people refusing to be vaccinated against the Coronavirus. Does this amount to de facto mandatory vaccination and, if so, why?

Coercion and blackmail hold no place in a democratic, civilised society and would actually break the law.

According to Medical Freedom Alliance

The Montgomery Judgement and Informed Consent

This Supreme Court judgement of Montgomery v Lanarkshire (2015) changed the standards of consent. The key passages from Montgomery Judgement state:



“...The doctor is therefore under a duty to take reasonable care to ensure that the patient is aware of any material risks involved in any recommended treatment, and of any reasonable alternative or variant treatments....”

“The test of materiality is whether, in the circumstances of the particular case, a reasonable person in the patient's position would be likely to attach significance to the risk, or the doctor is or should reasonably be aware that the particular patient would be likely to attach significance to it.”



Before Montgomery, a doctor's duty to warn patients of risks was based on whether they had acted in line with a responsible body of medical opinion - known as the “Bolam test”. Now, doctors must provide information about all material risks to which a reasonable person in the patient's position would attach significance. This puts the patient at the centre of consent process, as their understanding of material risk must be considered.



If doctors fail to properly discuss the risks and alternative treatments with the patient, this renders them personally responsible for damages. e.g.

https://covid19criticalcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/FLCCC-Ivermectin-in-the-prophylaxis-and-treatment-of-COVID-19.pdf



General Medical Council Guidance - Decision Making and Consent (2020)

https://www.gmc-uk.org/ethical-guidance/ethical-guidance-for-doctors/decision-making-and-consent)





This states that doctors MUST attempt to find out what matters to patients, so they can share information about the benefits and harms of proposed options and reasonable alternatives.



Note the word MUST makes this a legally binding directive.

GMC Guidance states doctors MUST address the following information:

a) Recognise risks of harm that you believe anyone in the patient’s position would want to know. You’ll know these already from your professional knowledge and experience.



b) The effect of the patient’s individual clinical circumstances on the probability of a benefit or harm occurring. If you know the patient’s medical history, you’ll know some of what you need to share already, but the dialogue could reveal more.



c) Risks of harm and potential benefits that the patient would consider significant for any reason. These will be revealed during your discussion with the patient about what matters to them.



d) Any risk of serious harm, however unlikely it is to occur.



e) Expected harms, including common side effects and what to do if they occur.





5. Could some restrictions be justified? For example, would mandating Coronavirus vaccination for employees in sensitive jobs like health or aged care be acceptable (allowing for reasonable exemptions for those unable to be vaccinated)?

A reasonable question to ask employers is: are they aware of the known short-term and long-term side effects of the experimental vaccines and have they conducted or commissioned risk-assessments for adverse vaccine reactions for each employee? All vaccines should be on a totally voluntary basis as none are risk-free and none are guaranteed to work. The right to informed consent is on the statute books and that should be respected by employers.

In such circumstances comprehensive information should be made available to all employees regarding available prophylaxis treatments (e.g. Ivermectin), which must be subject to an individual medical risk-assessment and informed consent, as alternatives to experimental vaccines only.

Immunologist: Pfizer, Moderna Vaccines Could Cause Long-Term Chronic Illness

https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/pfizer-moderna-vaccines-long-term-chronic-illness/?utm_source=salsa&eType=EmailBlastContent&eId=c0303641-a462-4bc7-afcc-d8c580145395

In new research published in Microbiology & Infectious Diseases, immunologist J. Bart Classen warns the mRNA technology used in the Pfizer and Moderna COVID vaccines could create “new potential mechanisms” of adverse events that may take years to come to light.

“…In a new research article published in Microbiology & Infectious Diseases, veteran immunologist J. Bart Classen expresses similar concerns and writes that “RNA-based COVID vaccines have the potential to cause more disease than the epidemic of COVID-19.”





For decades, Classen has published papers exploring how vaccination can give rise to chronic conditions such as Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes — not right away, but three or four years down the road.

In this latest paper, Classen warns that the RNA-based vaccine technology could create “new potential mechanisms” of vaccine adverse events that may take years to come to light.

Classen’s study establishes the potential for the messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines developed by Pfizer and Moderna to activate human proteins to take on “pathologic configurations” — configurations associated with chronic degenerative neurological diseases. Although his specific interest is in prion diseases (conditions associated with misfolded versions of normal proteins), Classen also outlines a handful of other mechanisms whereby RNA-based vaccines could give rise to “multiple other potential fatal adverse events.”

Ensuring that patients clearly understand risks — including known risks as well as potential unknown risks — is an important component of the informed consent process. This is all the more true when the intervention is experimental and lacks long-term safety data, as is the case with the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines against COVID-19. The FDA authorized the two vaccines for widespread emergency use based on just two months of clinical trial data...""

The UK Medical Freedom Alliance has written to the Secretary of State for Health and Social Security:

Re: Urgent warning re Covid-19 vaccine-related deaths in the elderly and Care Homes

https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa5866942937a4d73918723/601ffc3e56a64132caa3f42f_Open_Letter_from_the_UKMFA_Vaccine_Deaths_Care%20Homes.pdf

“In our Open Letter of 23 November 2020, addressed to the MHRA, JCVI and Matt Hancock, we outlined our concerns of potential public health risks from a mass roll-out of the Covid-19 vaccines because of only limited short-term safety data and no long-term safety data.

In this letter we draw to your attention the mounting evidence that the public health risks we identified may be materialising.

We now call for an immediate and urgent audit of deaths that have occurred since the beginning of the Covid-19 vaccine rollout, to ascertain if Covid-19 vaccines (in general or any one brand in particular) are leading to an increased number of deaths (Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 related), Covid- 19 cases or increased risk of death in certain age groups or cohorts.

Among our concerns in our previous Open Letter, we raised the potential issues of:

1. Antibody Dependent Enhancement (ADE) induced by the vaccines causing more severe Covid-19, with increased hospitalisations and deaths in the weeks or months after vaccinations.

2. The lack of safety data on elderly people with multiple comorbidities. This cohort was under represented and a statistically insignificant group in the clinical vaccine trials . We postulated that there may be increased vaccine side-effects in this group, which would only become apparent when many thousands of them had received vaccinations.

3. The absence of any safety data regarding those who have already had Covid-19, and the possibility that prior immunity may lead to increased side-effects from the Covid-19 vaccines….”





6. The right to bodily integrity is not absolute, and mandating vaccination to protect a population in a public health pandemic can sometimes be justified under international law, for example to protect the lives of others. Where do you think the line should be drawn between individual and group rights?

The right to bodily integrity is absolute. This is fully supported by the UK’s Supreme Court ruling on the right to informed consent. With experimental COVID-19 vaccines other international rulings like the Nuremberg code would also apply.

7. Some travel companies and airlines are planning to request vaccination travel certificates in order to use their services. Is this different from government-imposed restrictions, and if so why? Is it acceptable?

It would be wholly unacceptable. The article below from the BMJ clearly explains that ‘none of the trials currently under way are designed to detect a reduction in any serious outcome such as hospital admissions, use of intensive care, or deaths….nor are the vaccines being studied to determine whether they can interrupt transmission of the virus’.

https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4037?fbclid=IwAR1rCNMliE-dXWt4qS_Rv8-s_Onkk1DegX0qvHi522eZwDuTXIUhNOFLAPQ

In response to the pathologisation of perfectly healthy people, I would put forward these two large and official epidemiological studies showing zero transmission from so called asymptomatic carriers.

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19802-w... and https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32513410/.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, U.S. Director of National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Disease stated: ""In all the history of respiratory-borne viruses of any type, asymptomatic transmission has never been the driver of outbreaks. The driver of outbreaks is always a symptomatic person."" - https://youtu.be/JIOzN03ZWXY

If a travel company or airline wants to persist with this biologically implausible position that a perfectly healthy person showing no symptoms whatsoever, is a risk to others then the onus is on the company or airline to provide actual scientific studies (not models or conjecture or imaginings) showing otherwise.





8. The UK (and other) governments have exempted Coronavirus manufacturers from liability for vaccine damage, citing the urgent need for speedy development and low prices for vaccines (while offering limited government compensation). Is such an exemption justified? Is adequate compensation an important factor influencing willingness to accept a vaccination?

Such an exemption is not justified. If the manufacturers have faith in their products to be both safe and effective they should be prepared to back this up with their own money. The government’s limited vaccine damage payment awards are funded by the tax-payer.

The Department of Health, unfortunately, is in charge of two competing duties. On one hand it is responsible for vaccine safety. On the other hand it is responsible for promoting vaccine development, uptake and also defending against any claim of vaccine damage.

Regrettably, it appears that the Government has chosen to focus almost entirely on its vaccine promotion and defence function to such a degree that it has essentially abandoned its vaccine safety responsibility.

To restore balance, the Government must take serious steps to create an “ethics firewall” between these competing functions. The Government must also take action with regard to the JCVI and those in the MHRA (committee members/employees) that have direct and indirect conflicts of interest with vaccine manufacturers. In the interests of transparency and clarity the regulatory authorities should be totally independent of government and pharmaceutical industry influence.

Covid-19: politicisation, “corruption,” and suppression of science

Kamran Abassi, executive editor BMJ

BMJ 2020; 371 doi: https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.m4425 (Published 13 November 2020)

“When good science is suppressed by the medical-political complex, people die Politicians and governments are suppressing science. They do so in the public interest, they say, to accelerate availability of diagnostics and treatments. They do so to support innovation, to bring products to market at unprecedented speed. Both of these reasons are partly plausible; the greatest deceptions are founded in a grain of truth. But the underlying behaviour is troubling.

Science is being suppressed for political and financial gain. Covid-19 has unleashed state corruption on a grand scale, and it is harmful to public health.1 Politicians and industry are responsible for this opportunistic embezzlement. So too are scientists and health experts. The pandemic has revealed how the medical-political complex can be manipulated in an emergency—a time when it is even more important to safeguard science…”

A US author on vaccines and retired M.D. writes:

“…Appearing in the midst of these struggles for and against mandatory vaccination, the outbreak of COVID-19, whatever may have caused it, has provided the drug industry and its seemingly philanthropic, wealthy benefactors the perfect, almost heaven-sent opportunity to achieve their ultimate goals, as grandly set forth in the WHO Prospectus:

Immunization is a global health and development success story, saving millions of lives every year. It is the foundation of the primary health care system, an indisputable human right, and one of the best investments that money can buy. With the support of countries and partners, WHO is leading the creation of a new global strategy for the next decade. It envisions a world in which everyone, everywhere, and at every age fully benefits from vaccination to improve health and well-being.56

By proclaiming COVID-19 to be a pandemic, and a global health emergency, the CDC, the WHO, the vaccine industry, and their super-rich donors have succeeded not only in creating an atmosphere of fear and urgency, but in prolonging the economic shutdown that it inspires, and thereby bringing about the real-world conditions for the general public in most of the world to long for a vaccine as their only hope to escape from the crisis and return to a semblance of the life they were forced to leave behind…”





9. There has been some negative publicity concerning the views of often loosely-defined ‘anti-vaxxers’. For example, some are propagating the idea that vaccines implant micro-chips or are associated with companies are trying to selling alternative health products. Have you encountered prejudice towards your organisation for questioning the need for vaccination (regarding the Coronavirus or other vaccines)? Is social media helpful or otherwise for circulating information on the Coronavirus vaccine?

It is common practice for governments and the pharmaceutical industry to try and silence and alienate those who challenge their narrative that all vaccines are “safe and effective”. Hence, leading politicians resort either directly or indirectly, through a compliant media, to attack groups or individuals by labelling them as “anti-vaxxers”. This is a blatant tactic to embarrass, expose, encourage and convince people that their views and concerns are misguided. I would certainly question why any person would challenge or refuse a totally “safe and effective” medical intervention that was risk-free and without complication if that was indeed the case.

Without being disrespectful to the vast majority of journalists who write or broadcast on the subject of vaccination, it is a very complex issue that has been politicised and manipulated to such an extent it is difficult for anyone to get to the truth. Politics, censorship and propaganda now rule the roost.

In my opinion, since the Leveson Inquiry in the UK, the media has been steered into a ""biased"" position of following the government's narrative. Part of this enquiry in 2012, which was supposed to be about the phone hacking scandal, reported on how the press gave too many column inches to vaccine damage cases/parents’ opinions and not enough emphasis on the government's/pharmaceutical industry's science: ""vaccines are safe and effective"" full stop.

https://discoverleveson.com/evidence/Submission_by_Sense_about_Science/11654/media

https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/tag/covid-19/

Not liking the overtones of the threat to press freedoms the media has been blatantly ""encouraged"" to follow the government's version of ""the science."" Current newspaper headlines demonstrate this perfectly by playing up the fact that UK citizens are the first in the world to be offered inadequately safety tested vaccines as a positive whilst ignoring the ability of COVID-19 vaccines to prevent serious disease or transmission and demonstrates a callous disregard for the known short-term and potential long-term side-effects these new experimental vaccines may cause.

“PROBLEM - REACTION - SOLUTION” or the “Hegel's Dialectic” from the German philosopher - Georg Wilhelm Frederich Hegel

“Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism, and exposing the country to greater danger” - Herman Goering

So, what is going on here with the Coronavirus crisis? The manipulating body (government) creates a problem and then directs the media to incessantly focus on it without recourse. The media can create a false perception that a big problem exists even if it doesn’t. Once you have created this problem you make sure that an individual group or an aspect of society is blamed. The solution to the problem is always a further curtailment of freedom and/or manipulation of an agenda - the continuation of restrictions, lockdowns and further curtailments of our freedoms. As an example:

Problem: People not complying with draconian rules or not taking the COVID vaccination whilst the Government’s agenda is to “nudge” the whole UK population into acceptance through fear.

Reaction: Government makes an aggressive attempt to close down the rights of people, including doctors and scientists, to question and challenge policies which includes the safety and efficacy of the inadequately tested experimental COVID vaccines.

Solution: Government creates a media frenzy over those they claim are “anti-vaxxers” or sceptics that dare challenge the official narrative. The Government attacks social media and condemns alternative opinions as “fake news”.

A perfect example of this government lead compliant media propaganda is the BBC Panorama programme aired on the 15 February 2021 which was accurately criticised by Hugo Talks:

At present we live in a democracy and therefore the people of this country have the right to freedom of expression and to engage and challenge those who make the decisions with regard to COVID-19 emergency measures and vaccination.

For democracy to work people need to trust those in positions of power and expect them to act in the best interests of the public’s health and wellbeing, and not be beholden to public/private partnerships or other corporate interests, e.g. vaccine production and marketing. Forcing questionable public health policies that trample on personal human rights, for the claimed greater good, also threatens the liberties of the individual and community which are the very foundation of a civilised democratic society which should be coveted and protected by everyone.

Most of the points in the email below were sent to us anonymously through a message on our Facebook page - JABS: Justice, Awareness & Basic Support. We felt the points were strong and referenced so we have made use of them.

With many thanks to the “Airline Pilot""

Dear Andy Burnham

I am appalled to read in today’s Daily Mail the headline “NO JAB? YOU’RE BARRED”:

Yet again the psychological pressure is being ramped up by this Government to comply with their disproportionate diktats which are breaking laws and minds whilst attempting to take away our human rights.

In my opinion, no one should be consenting to any jab until these experimental vaccines have gone through long-term, double-blind placebo trials in volunteers to determine the absolute safety and efficacy for the target population.

Clearly the mainstream media is now carrying implied government threats against anyone who declines the vaccines.

Here are some of our concerns:

1. You must be vaccinated or you will be barred

All vaccines against the SARS-COV-2 virus are still officially on trial. Pfizer trials, for instance, won’t be completed until January 29th 2023. (1)

All the proposed vaccines, by definition, are novel. No candidate vaccine has been in development for more than several months and several utilise novel technology which has not previously been used. There is therefore no long-term safety data whatsoever which can either be relied upon or used to form the basis of any argument in favour of coercion - “or else”- mandates. Anyone having the vaccine once it is rolled out in the coming weeks will be part of a wider ongoing medical experiment.

Under the Nuremberg Code voluntary consent of the human subject in any medical experiment is absolutely essential. This means that the person involved should have legal capacity to give consent and should be able to exercise free power of choice, without the intervention of any element of force, fraud, deceit, duress, overreaching, or other ulterior form of constraint or coercion, and should have sufficient knowledge and comprehension of the elements of the subject matter involved as to enable him or her to fully understand and make an informed decision.

In simple terms, informed consent affords someone the absolute right to say no, and the threats of loss of access, employment or other democratic rights and privileges constitutes coercion.

2. Your right to autonomy over your own body does not include your right to ‘infect’ others.

This is a hypothetical, pseudoscientific and very manipulative tactic, intended as a psychological guilt trip to support their straw man statements.

This article from the BMJ which clearly explains that: ‘none of the trials currently under way are designed to detect a reduction in any serious outcome such as hospital admissions, use of intensive care, or deaths….nor are the vaccines being studied to determine whether they can interrupt transmission of the virus…’ (2)

Additionally, Moderna’s chief medical officer states that: “they do not show that they prevent you from potentially carrying this virus transiently and infecting others” (3)

The reality is that according to their own data there is only a 0.76% absolute risk reduction (in the end user only) against the onset of mild cold symptoms against a total of 2% of all participants who reported significant systemic adverse events akin to influenza.

3. Asymptomatic spread is real and dangerous

In response to this pathologisation (over diagnosis) of perfectly healthy people, here are two large and official epidemiological studies showing zero transmission from so called asymptomatic carriers (4)(5).

Dr. Anthony Fauci, U.S. Director of National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Disease stated:

""In all the history of respiratory-borne viruses of any type, asymptomatic transmission has never been the driver of outbreaks. The driver of outbreaks is always a symptomatic person."" -(6)

If this Government wants to persist with this biologically implausible position that perfectly healthy people showing no symptoms whatsoever, are a risk to others then the onus is on them to provide evidence with actual scientific studies not models or conjecture showing otherwise.

4. You cannot fulfil your employment role unless you are vaccinated

The MHRA has stated that they are expecting high volumes of adverse events (7).

Employers have a duty of care to their employees, which means that they should take all steps which are reasonably possible to ensure their health, safety and wellbeing. Demonstrating concern for the physical and mental health of workers shouldn't just be seen as a legal duty - there's a clear benefit to building trust and reinforcing commitment to their welfare.

Legally, employers must abide by relevant health and safety and employment law, as well as the common law duty of care. They also have a moral and ethical duty not to cause, or fail to prevent, physical or psychological injury, and must fulfil their responsibilities with regard to personal injury and negligence claims.

If there is an implied requirement or instruction from a third party outside of the organisation that the employees of that organisation must be vaccinated, then it is up to the company to provide an exemption against such measures.

Organisations should provide the scientific studies that prove SARS-COV-2 even exists and is proven to cause the syndrome known as COVID-19. There have now been several FOIA documents which show that no government body holds this information. Additionally, there is the ethical standpoint that the vaccines not only contain, or are produced, using human foetal cells but also involve the widespread use of animal experimentation.

To therefore coerce someone into having a medical intervention as part of an ongoing experiment with potentially extremely serious side effects and where neither the safety profile or efficacy has been established and for which there is little substantiated data or scientific evidence even suggesting a reduction in transmission is quite simply untenable (8).

I will state again, for democracy to work people need to trust those in positions of power and expect them to act in the best interests of the public’s health and safety and not be beholden to public/private partnerships or other corporate interests, e.g., pharmaceutical industry vaccine production and marketing. Forcing questionable public health policies that trample on personal human rights, for the claimed greater good, also threatens the liberties of the individual and community which are the very foundation of a civilised democratic society which should be coveted and protected by everyone.

I would appreciate it if you could consider the above points and opinions carefully and raise any/all of these points with the Prime Minister, Chief Medical Officer and other appropriate authorities. I look forward to your reply.

Yours sincerely

The BMJ Opinion 26 November 2020

Peter Doshi: Pfizer and Moderna’s “95% effective” vaccines—let’s be cautious and first see the full data

Only full transparency and rigorous scrutiny of the data will allow for informed decision making, argues Peter Doshi

In the United States, all eyes are on Pfizer and Moderna. The topline efficacy results from their experimental covid-19 vaccine trials are astounding at first glance. Pfizer says it recorded 170 covid-19 cases (in 44,000 volunteers), with a remarkable split: 162 in the placebo group versus 8 in the vaccine group. Meanwhile Moderna says 95 of 30,000 volunteers in its ongoing trial got covid-19: 90 on placebo versus 5 receiving the vaccine, leading both companies to claim around 95% efficacy.

Let’s put this in perspective. First, a relative risk reduction is being reported, not absolute risk reduction, which appears to be less than 1%. Second, these results refer to the trials’ primary endpoint of covid-19 of essentially any severity, and importantly not the vaccine’s ability to save lives, nor the ability to prevent infection, nor the efficacy in important subgroups (e.g. frail elderly). Those still remain unknown. Third, these results reflect a time point relatively soon after vaccination, and we know nothing about vaccine performance at 3, 6, or 12 months, so cannot compare these efficacy numbers against other vaccines like influenza vaccines (which are judged over a season). Fourth, children, adolescents, and immunocompromised individuals were largely excluded from the trials, so we still lack any data on these important populations.

I previously argued that the trials are studying the wrong endpoint, and for an urgent need to correct course and study more important endpoints like prevention of severe disease and transmission in high risk people. Yet, despite the existence of regulatory mechanisms for ensuring vaccine access while keeping the authorization bar high (which would allow placebo-controlled trials to continue long enough to answer the important question), it’s hard to avoid the impression that sponsors are claiming victory and wrapping up their trials (Pfizer has already sent trial participants a letter discussing “crossing over” from placebo to vaccine), and the FDA will now be under enormous pressure to rapidly authorize the vaccines.

But as conversation shifts to vaccine distribution, let’s not lose sight of the evidence. Independent scrutiny of the underlying trial data will increase trust and credibility of the results. There also might be important limitations to the trial findings we need to be aware of.

Most crucially, we need data-driven assurances that the studies were not inadvertently unblinded, by which I mean investigators or volunteers could make reasonable guesses as to which group they were in. Blinding is most important when measuring subjective endpoints like symptomatic covid-19, and differences in post-injection side-effects between vaccine and placebo might have allowed for educated guessing. Past placebo-controlled trials of influenza vaccine were not able to fully maintain blinding of vaccine status, and the recent “half dose” mishap in the Oxford covid-19 vaccine trial was apparently only noticed because of milder-than-expected side-effects. (And that is just one of many concerns with the Oxford trial.)

In contrast to a normal saline placebo, early phase trials suggested that systemic and local adverse events are common in those receiving vaccine. In one Pfizer trial, for example, more than half of the vaccinated participants experienced headache, muscle pain and chills—but the early phase trials were small, with large margins of error around the data. Few details from the large phase 3 studies have been released thus far. Moderna’s press releasestates that 9% experienced grade 3 myalgia and 10% grade 3 fatigue; Pfizer’s statement reported 3.8% experienced grade 3 fatigue and 2% grade 3 headache. Grade 3 adverse events are considered severe, defined as preventing daily activity. Mild and moderate severity reactions are bound to be far more common.

One way the trial’s raw data could facilitate an informed judgment as to whether any potential unblinding might have affected the results is by analyzing how often people with symptoms of covid-19 were referred for confirmatory SARS-CoV-2 testing. Without a referral for testing, a suspected covid-19 case could not become a confirmed covid-19 case, and thus is a crucial step in order to be counted as a primary event: lab-confirmed, symptomatic covid-19. Because some of the adverse reactions to the vaccine are themselves also symptoms of covid-19 (e.g. fever, muscle pain), one might expect a far larger proportion of people receiving vaccine to have been swabbed and tested for SARS-CoV-2 than those receiving placebo.

This assumes all people with symptoms would be tested, as one might expect would be the case. However the trial protocols for Moderna and Pfizer’s studies contain explicit language instructing investigators to use their clinical judgment to decide whether to refer people for testing. Moderna puts it this way:

“It is important to note that some of the symptoms of COVID-19 overlap with solicited systemic ARs that are expected after vaccination with mRNA-1273 (eg, myalgia, headache, fever, and chills). During the first 7 days after vaccination, when these solicited ARs are common, Investigators should use their clinical judgement to decide if an NP swab should be collected.”

This amounts to asking investigators to make guesses as to which intervention group patients were in. But when the disease and the vaccine side-effects overlap, how is a clinician to judge the cause without a test? And why were they asked, anyway?

Importantly, the instructions only refer to the first seven days following vaccination, leaving unclear what role clinician judgment could play in the key days afterward, when cases of covid-19 could begin counting towards the primary endpoint. (For Pfizer, 7 days after the 2nd dose. For Moderna, 14 days.)

In a proper trial, all cases of covid-19 should have been recorded, no matter which arm of the trial the case occurred in. (In epidemiology terms, there should be no ascertainment bias, or differential measurement error). It’s even become common sense in the Covid era: “test, test, test.” But if referrals for testing were not provided to all individuals with symptoms of covid-19—for example because an assumption was made that the symptoms were due to side-effects of the vaccine—cases could go uncounted.

Data on pain and fever reducing medicines also deserve scrutiny. Symptoms resulting from a SARS-CoV-2 infection (e.g. fever or body aches) can be suppressed by pain and fever reducing medicines. If people in the vaccine arm took such medicines prophylactically, more often, or for a longer duration of time than those in the placebo arm, this could have led to greater suppression of covid-19 symptoms following SARS-CoV-2 infection in the vaccine arm, translating into a reduced likelihood of being suspected for covid-19, reduced likelihood of testing, and therefore reduced likelihood of meeting the primary endpoint. But in such a scenario, the effect was driven by the medicines, not the vaccine.

Neither Moderna nor Pfizer have released any samples of written materials provided to patients, so it is unclear what, if any, instructions patients were given regarding the use of medicines to treat side effects following vaccination, but the informed consent form for Johnson and Johnson’s vaccine trial provides such a recommendation:

“Following administration of Ad26.COV2.S, fever, muscle aches and headache appear to be more common in younger adults and can be severe. For this reason, we recommend you take a fever reducer or pain reliever if symptoms appear after receiving the vaccination, or upon your study doctor’s recommendation.”

There may be much more complexity to the “95% effective” announcement than meets the eye—or perhaps not. Only full transparency and rigorous scrutiny of the data will allow for informed decision making. The data must be made public.

Forced Vaccination Law in Denmark Abandoned After Public Protests

Would have given authorities power to have police restrain and inject refusniks.

'A law in Denmark that would have given authorities the power to forcibly inject people with a coronavirus vaccine has been abandoned after nine days of public protests.

The ‘epidemic law’ would have handed the Danish government the power to enact mandatory quarantine measures against anyone infected with a dangerous disease, but it was the part about vaccinations that caused the biggest uproar.

“The Danish Health Authority would be able to define groups of people who must be vaccinated in order to contain and eliminate a dangerous disease,” reports the Local.

“People who refuse the above can – in some situations – be coerced through physical detainment, with police allowed to assist.”

However, after nine straight days of protests against the new law, it has now been scrapped.

With a coronavirus vaccine within sight, governments across the world are mulling over what punitive measures to bring against those who refuse to take it.

Last week we highlighted how both Ticketmaster and airline companies are considering barring people from entering venues and flying if they cannot prove they have taken the vaccine.

So while public protests may be able to prevent authorities carrying out forced vaccinations, people who refuse to take the shot may find it virtually impossible to enjoy any kind of social life, use public transport, or even find employment.’

Re: Covid-19: GPs told to be ready to deliver vaccine from next month

Rapid Response By Jackie Fletcher, JABS

Dear Editor

The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the executive agency of the Department of Health and Social Care. This body is responsible for issuing an emergency licence to allow the use of Covid-19 vaccines in the UK if the licence is required urgently.

The MHRA should NOT authorise Covid-19 vaccines when the agency is already anticipating 'high volume of Covid-19 vaccine Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs)'. (1)

Neither should the agency authorise Covid-19 vaccines when the agency admits that it does not have the technology in place to process ADRs and '...it will be unable to process these ADRs effectively. This will hinder its ability to rapidly identify any potential safety issues with the Covid-19 vaccine and represents a direct threat to patient life and public health....'. (1)

In my opinion, the MHRA has already been failing the public; on its website it states that: '..It is estimated that only 10% of serious reactions and between 2 and 4% of non-serious reactions are reported...'. (2) I cannot find any information to show that they are addressing this potentially dangerous finding.

During a meeting with the MHRA which I have attended, officers have stated that the reports that they do receive are not routinely followed-up by contacting the reporting health professional, six months to 12 months later, to determine if the individual fully recovered from the reaction or has further deteriorated.

Without this information neither the MHRA nor doctors have any accurate safety data on vaccines. A point that has been raised with the Government time and time again. (3) (4)

Currently anyone who takes a Covid-19 vaccine may not be aware that the procedure is loaded with risks for the above reasons and also because there is no financial safety net for anybody harmed in the process. The vaccine manufacturers have sought and been given indemnities to protect them from potential vaccine damage claims. (5) I understand that health professionals who administer the vaccines will also be protected against claims.

The proposed Covid-19 vaccine, as with all vaccines, will carry a risk of serious injury or death. Vaccine manufacturers' product information sheets attest to this with other vaccines. A recent example is the H1N1 vaccine which was introduced quickly into the population in 2009 and was found to be linked with narcolepsy and Guillain Barre syndrome (6) (7)

Contrary to how most MPs and the Prime Minister presents people who complain of vaccine damage and labels them as: 'anti-vaxxers are nuts' (8), the Government is fully aware of the risks that vaccines pose to the public. Vaccine damage payments of over £74 million have been awarded to people severely damaged. However, Covid-19 vaccine is not listed on the eligible to claim section. (9) The Vaccine Damage Payment Act 1979 would need to be amended to include all people over the age of 21 years and the awards should be made appropriate to the damage sustained on a par with current product liability claims.

As it stands, the Covid-19 vaccine is being promoted as the saviour of the country and according to the media reports, no serious concerns have shown up in the trials.The MHRA, with the authority to licence this vaccine, admits in tender documents that they are expecting a high volume of ADRs but don't have the technology to cope which they say is a direct threat to patient life and public health.

Meanwhile, the only people taking any risk whatsoever are the people holding their arms out.

JABS Transcript:

Hi Anna (Brees), my name is Graham Hutchinson and I just want to thank you for you setting up these platforms so people like me can speak about our feelings about what’s going on with COVID-19.

A little bit about myself, I really don’t like talking about myself, but who does? I was one of the Senior Chief Biomedical Scientists at the Centre of Public Health laboratory at Colindale. I worked in the Division of Hospital and Respiratory Infection and Anti-microbial Reference Unit.

We were responsible for the day-to-day monitoring of outbreaks of infection throughout the country. I was responsible for the running of the MRSA Reference Unit, the GRAM Negative Unit, the Molecular PCR Typing Unit, the Identification Unit, Hospital Hygiene Unit and other various laboratories within our division.

I was also personally responsible for the global reference service for the category three organisms francisella tularensis and burkholderia pseudomallei.

Just, I know people like to verify who people are: I’m, whist there, I worked with Professors Hodson and Gedis at the Royal Brompton Hospital doing research on home used nebulisers of cystic fibrosis patients and burkholderia cenocepacia lethal pathogen for them, there being a primary source thereof, and you can google that I also worked with Professor Nolan of New Zealand on the effect of Manuka honey being bactericidal against MRSA strains vancomycin resistant enterococci and other organisms, and various other works I did here.

Before that I was the Chief Biomedical Scientist at the Royal Brompton Hospital, responsible for the day-to-day running of the Microbiology Department, Bacteriology, Tuberculosis Laboratory, parasitology, media, that kind of stuff. And again, if someone wanted to verify they can. I did a paper with Chadwick and Gaia on a team of sitting activity against haemophilia influenza.

This is only going to be a short video, there’s, I don’t think there’s any use these days of videos going on but on, five or ten minutes at most. so I’m gonna keep this very short and just concentrate on three areas which I think are currently being missed.

The first one and most important I would say is virus attenuation. When vaccines are produced they are passed through cell lines and they go from cell line to cell line to cell line passaging, and as the virus passages it gradually gets weaker and weaker and weaker until it is to such a stage that it can be used as a live vaccine.

Back in April, Guarde et al had already noted that there was what they termed as viral drift amongst the genomes where the COVID-19 was changing and Yayo et al were showing that there were changes in the spike of the virus - and regards to pathogenicity he also said that because most of the strains have been submitted for genome analysis were from highly dangerous cases and that people that were heavily infected that there was probably even more viral drift because they weren’t looking at genomes from mild cases. So that’s the first thing that I think really needs to be looked at.

We’re seeing a lot more cases and a lot less deaths all over the world and in my view COVID-19 is not the same organism as it was when it was first isolated and has now very low pathogenicity. I would recommend everybody to go to and look at a website called https://nextstrain.org and just look at the numbers of genomes and what’s going on is there are thousands and thousands now of different strains of COVID-19.

So when someone says COVID-19 as a virus it’s not, it is now a huge family of viruses derived from the first Wuhan strain - and when you think about it bats carry the organism - normally they’re not cured by the virus - what point is there to a species if it kills its host? So I believe we are now seeing a less virulent but more contagious virus that is spreading everywhere.

The next thing I’d like to talk about is influenza vaccine. Cowling et al did a study where they showed that those who were given influenza vaccination were significantly more likely to develop other non-influenza respiratory infections after getting the influenza vaccination. Currently we’re seeing in South Korea there have been 83 deaths following influenza vaccination mostly in elderly people and Singapore have actually stopped giving influenza vaccination.

There were so few cases in the southern hemisphere this year that the World Health Organisation literally had to guess what strains to put in the vaccine for the northern hemisphere. So I think there should be a watch or a warning, an alert going on where, if anyone does fall sick following a flu vaccination this should be flagged very urgently and the last thing I want to talk about and in a way connected, is masks.

There’s a Danish study which we’re all waiting to be published which I’m sure is going to show that masks are useless. There was a study by McIntyre where he did a randomised controlled trial on sixteen hundred healthcare workers and found that those with cloth masks were more likely to be infected with the influenza virus than those with no masks. So let me just say that again, that those with cloth masks were more likely to get influenza infection than those with no masks. Influenza virus is actually larger than COVID-19.

There was also a South Korean study which was very quickly retracted which, where they took four heavily infected patients with COVID-19 and got them to cough with various masks and no masks, and they found that COVID-19 went through the masks - and not only that the virus actually aggregated on the outside of the mask - so all this touching of masks when people are out shopping and touching things is actually more dangerous than no masks and the aggregation on the outside has been shown by other studies too.

So that brings me to a connection between the influenza and mask because if we are seeing influenza disappearing throughout the world, yet we know that masks are not effective in stopping influenza, then where have the cases gone? My view is that there is some severe misdiagnosis going on and once again this PCR test needs to be looked at.

So those are my three areas - I’ll go through them again - it’s virus attenuation, I think we’re now looking at low pathogenic strain compared to the original strain; masks are not working and flu vaccination is something we should be aware of.

So I hope people can do some research on these and try and make these more in the public domain. So thanks once again for giving me this opportunity and I totally endorse everything that Doctor Mike Yeadon has been saying - it’s crazy times and sadly we’ve lost the science somewhere.

Okay - thanks - bye-bye

Money Talks Part 3 - Dr Reiner Fuellmich 13 October 2020

With thanks to Gareth Hawker for this transcript taken from the youtube video which he punctuated:

Money Talks part 3 Dr. Reiner Fuellmich class action case against Pandemic scandal



Since the German PCR test, (first pushed by Professor Drosten of the Charité hospital in Berlin, and produced and marketed by a German company by the name of Tib-Molbiol) was, on the recommendation of the World Health Organization, also one of the first tests to be marketed worldwide including in the US, the US courts have jurisdiction for a class action to be filed against Drosten, Charité, Tib-Molbiol, and the World Health Organization.



If such a class action then leads to a decision in favour of the representative plaintiff - and the judgment becomes final - then this judgment is binding for the defendants with respect to every other member of the class too. Now, our corona committee's primary political goal is to start the long overdue public scientific discussion about, among other things: the true danger of the virus; the reliability of the tests; and, above all, the collateral damage caused by the anti-corona measures - both from a health and economic point of view.



And this political goal will be reached faster, we believe, if a very loud bang ends the current stampede of panic and confusion; and that is in fact the political purpose of this class action. If hundreds of thousands or even millions of people decide to go to court over this, this sends a signal that will, I believe, interrupt and stop the stampede; and will make this badly needed public scientific discussion possible.



So the higher the price tag of the damage claims, the louder this bang becomes.



By the way, making the victims of the anti-corona measures whole is not only legally possible, but it also makes very clear sense economically; and that is because if we don't reimburse those small and medium-sized corporations and the self-employed for the damages they suffered, and they then all filed for bankruptcy, this would trigger enormous tax losses; but also enormous social transfer payments for (among other things) long-term unemployment payments; and that would, in any case, be much more expensive than to compensate the injured parties now, and to immediately end the measures so that those injured parties have a fair chance of restarting their businesses.



Thank you

Money Talks Update 1. 15 October 2020

By Dr Reiner Fuellmich

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kod8XTnhKGE&fbclid=IwAR1c-zETiDSyhGpqvMea4NDmC6lNHETI756h-zE_xtSOml-lGlnmVI5RnjwHello,



I am Reiner Fuellmich and for 26 years I have worked as a trial lawyer in Germany and in California, representing consumers and small corporations against fraudulent large corporations like Deutsche Bank, VW and Kuehne and Nagel, the world's largest shipping company - the latter one for bribery.



There is a new very positive development in this corona scandal which I would like to share with you.



1. The Off-Guardian reported on October 8, 2020 that the World Health Organization, the WHO, disclosed in a meeting on October 5th 2020 that it assumes that around 10 percent of the world's population is infected with SARS-COV-2. This means that SARS-COV-2 is roughly as dangerous as the seasonal flu.



I'll read this to you from the Off-Guardian article:



“The global population is roughly 7.8 billion people. If 10 percent have been infected (that is 780 million people) the global death-toll currently attributed to SARS-COV-2 infections is one million sixty one thousand five hundred and thirty nine. That's an infection fatality rate of roughly point one four percent (0.14%)- right in line with the seasonal flu, and the predictions of many experts from all around the world.



2. It must be emphasized once again, however, that the notorious Wuhan virus has not been isolated by anyone in a scientifically correct manner. Nowhere has the virus been isolated according to Koch's postulates even the CDC reported in a document dated July 13, 2020, on page 39, that (and I quote): “No quantified virus isolates of the 2019 encounter are currently available”.



Quantified means measured. This means that no measurable amount of the virus is available. So what is being treated out there if it isn't SARS-COV-2? Is it the flu with a little more corona than usual? Is the flu being treated with a lockdown, a mask requirement and quarantine? Even the WHO seems to be having second thoughts. Now Dr David Nabarro from the WHO appealed to world leaders telling them last week to stop (and I quote): “Using lockdowns as your primary control method.”



Let me quote a little more from his message: “Lockdowns have just one consequence that you must never ever belittle, and that is making poor people an awful lot poorer.”



He also says: “Look what's happened to smallholder farmers all over the world. Look what's happening to poverty levels. It seems that we may well have a doubling of world poverty by next year. We may well have at least a doubling of child malnutrition.”



His message is timely. In a world-first, a number of health experts from all over the world came together calling for an end to coronavirus lockdowns earlier last week. They created a petition called the Great Barrington Declaration which said that lockdowns were doing irreparable damage. As infectious disease epidemiologists and public health scientists, they say we have grave concerns about the damaging physical and mental health impacts of the prevailing Covid-19 policies, and recommend, “an approach we call focused protection.”



Current lockdown policies are producing devastating effects on short and long-term public health. Against this backdrop the fact remains that there's no corona pandemic but only a PCR test pandemic (as I explained in my last video) and that means that those who deliberately make false statements claiming that PCR tests can detect infections, with whatever, will be held responsible.



By the way what happened and what continues to happen here is nothing new. At the beginning of the last century the US judiciary had to intervene vigorously to stop the massive abuse of power by corporations - at that time the financial industry and the oil companies. My personal legal hero Justice Lewis D. Brandeis, at the supreme court, became the so-called people's lawyer, because he got that job done for the people. This time we will do that.

Thank you.

Mark Dolan: ""Herd immunity might have saved lives, not taken them""

Mark Dolan: ""Herd immunity might have saved lives, not taken them""

During the run-up to the Brexit referendum of 2016, feels like the good old days now, doesn’t it, Michael Gove in that campaign said: “He had had enough of experts.” Now at the time, well I thought he was a bit of a silly sausage for saying that. Well, now, I know exactly what he means. Wherever you look, data, not projections or imaginary graphs, but data suggest lockdowns may be having little effect. They may, in fact, be counterproductive and at the moment the areas that have seen the strictest restrictions are producing the highest numbers of cases. It’s funny that, isn’t it, it’s almost as if you can’t halt the spread of an infectious virus, like it has got its own curve, its own trajectory, who knew?

Now, let’s talk about the Nightingale hospitals, this is important: when they were constructed at lightening speed early in the pandemic the Nightingale hospitals were considered a proud national achievement, however, months on they lie empty, they were never used. Far from being a great national achievement the Nightingale hospitals now stand as expensive monuments to scientific miscalculation. We didn’t want to use them, of course not, but it’s telling that we never got close to having to, and don’t get me started on ventilators. Do you remember the hysterical clamour for ventilators? We’ve got to have ventilators! We’ve got to have ventilators! Well, we have those ventilators, half a billion pounds worth, that’s right, half a billion pounds worth, almost every single one of them unused and gathering dust. It’s not an achievement, it’s a scandal.

Now in my book, everyone gets a free pass for what happened in March; COVID was an unknown quantity and a three or four week lockdown to ensure our wonderful NHS is not overwhelmed, it’s got to be worth a punt. At this point I will remind you the virus peaked in April.

So, here we are now in October and the madness continues unabated. Bars and restaurants in central Scotland have shut down; a devastating hammer blow to the economies of Glasgow, Edinburgh and beyond. It’s borderline criminal.

It’s pretty clear that first minister Sturgeon, sorry - sorry, General Sturgeon, we have upgraded her, remember Scotland is now just a semi-democracy. General Sturgeon is actually in charge of UK COVID strategy because when General Sturgeon locks down, corporal Johnson, her underling in Westminster, follows suit. But it’s actually, it’s not for Boris or for Nicola, or any of the politicians that I reserve my ire today. I have reserved my ire, and I’ve got loads of ire, so much ire and I have reserved it for the so-called experts.

Pick Messrs Whitty and Vallance, the worst double-act since Hale and Pace, with their projections of doom and the graph that wasn’t a graph, or the randy Prof., Neil Ferguson, a man who terrified the Prime Minister all those months ago with a projected death toll of half-a-million. This is a crisis of politics, certainly, but it’s an even bigger crisis of science.

Sweden, a surprisingly highly densely populated country, that did not lock down, kept its schools, hospitality and offices open and never mandated face coverings, well Sweden, a bit like those Nightingale hospitals, serves as a potentially huge embarrassment to the science and projections that we followed here. Sweden, by the looks of it, shames us. Now, perhaps everyone in Sweden is suddenly going to get COVID in the next ten minutes and if so, fair enough. But according to most experts the Swedes are out of the woods now and life there is more or less back to normal, no curfews, no masks, no arrows in shops. Are you sick of those arrows?

Voices of dissent are growing. The University of Edinburgh have just published a report in which they say that our failure to achieve herd immunity by attempting to control the virus, may now, cause more deaths in the long-run because we have lower community immunity. Now, do you remember the moral backlash about how brutal and Darwenistic and cruel the concept of herd immunity was? Do you remember that moral backlash? Well, we are now hearing that the much maligned herd immunity might have saved lives not cost them. Yes, it turns out that viruses aren’t Woke. They don’t look at Twitter. They’re not on Facebook. They don’t care what we think and, as we have been attacked by viruses throughout our natural history, they never have.

There are growing concerns from many thousands of globally renowned scientists and medics, who have signed up to the campaign called the Great Barrington Declaration, to change course and they fear we are going to hell in a handcart, with at best flaky and at worst wrong science and the folly continues as we await this famed vaccine. Now, I can tell you, I’ll give you an exclusive, on Drive, on what the main ingredient of this vaccine currently is - snake oil. Because to have a strategy that presides over the destruction of economies, societies and peoples way of life for hope of a vaccine is like watching your house burn down in the hope that someone will eventually come along and retro-fit a sprinkler system.

And so now, as Rome metaphorically burns, businesses closing, shops and restaurants boarded up, unemployment spiralling, national debt exploding and many thousands of other illnesses going undiagnosed and untreated, our Prime Minister is considering further draconian lockdowns in the north of England producing further economic and social devastation and perpetuating the north-south divide for at least another generation. Kind of the opposite of levelling up, I think you will agree.

We need a far wider diversity of views on this. We need a national conversation and I want to have it here at TalkRADIO.

Local Mayors and city officials are already digging their heels in, we’ve spoken to them on this programme. I’m following a court case in Spain, the City of Madrid have just said: No! We have to stop the madness and the only way to do that is to look at the data, have a wider range of voices advising the Government and work out where we are going wrong.

This, actually, isn’t politics and it shouldn’t be up to the politicians. It’s the science, stupid!

Crimes against Humanity 3 October 2020

Reiner Fuellmich - admitted to the bar in Germany and California for 26 years - explains the background for a worldwide class action suit against the perpetrators of the coronavirus scandal.

A team of worldwide lawyers and scientists are investigating the illegality of the coronavirus pandemic.

Lord Jonathan Sumption and Dr Mike Yeadon are quoted in the video.

Please click on picture





This is the transcript taken from the video. Please accept our apologies if any of the names are incorrect - with thanks to Gareth Hawker for his considerable help with this.

Hello. I am Reiner Fuellmich and I have been admitted to the bar in Germany and in California for 26 years.

I have been practicing law primarily as a trial lawyer against fraudulent corporations such as Deutsche bank, formerly one of the world's largest and most respected banks, today one of the most toxic criminal organisations in the world; VW, one of the world's largest and most respected car manufacturers, today notorious for its giant diesel fraud; and Cunard and Niagara the world's largest shipping company. We're suing them in a multi-million-dollar bribery case.

I'm also one of four members of the German Corona Investigative Committee. Since July 10, 2020, this committee has been listening to a large number of international scientists and experts' testimony - to find answers to questions about the corona crisis which more and more people worldwide are asking.

All the above mentioned cases of corruption and fraud committed by the German corporations pale in comparison in view of the extent of the damage that the corona crisis has caused and continues to cause.

This corona crisis, according to all we know today, must be renamed a corona scandal; and those responsible for it must be criminally prosecuted and sued for civil damages.

On a political level, everything must be done to make sure that no one will ever again be in a position of such power as to be able to defraud humanity, or to attempt to manipulate us with their corrupt agendas. And, for this reason, I will now explain to you how and where an international network of lawyers will argue this biggest tort case ever - the corona fraud scandal - which has meanwhile unfolded into probably the greatest crime against humanity ever committed.

Crimes against humanity were first defined in connection with the Nuremberg trials after World War II, that is when they dealt with the main war criminals of the Third Reich. Crimes against humanity are today regulated in section 7 of the International Criminal Code.

The three major questions to be answered in the context of a judicial approach to the corona scandal are:

1. Is there a corona pandemic or is there only a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test pandemic, specifically does a positive PCR test result mean that the person tested is infected with COVID-19, or does it mean absolutely nothing in connection with the COVID-19 infection?

2. Do the so-called anti-corona measures such as the lockdown, mandatory face masks, social distancing and quarantine regulations serve to protect the world's population from corona, or do these measures serve only to make people panic - so that they believe without asking any questions that their lives are in danger, so that in the end the pharmaceutical and tech industries can generate huge profits from the sale of PCR tests, antigen and antibody tests and vaccines, as well as the harvesting of our genetic fingerprints?

3. Is it true that the German government was massively lobbied more, so than any other country, by the chief protagonists of this so-called corona pandemic?

Dr Christian Drosten, virologist and Director of the Institute at Charité Hospital in Berlin;

Mr Lothar Wieler, veterinarian and head of the German equivalent of the CDC, the RKI;

and Mr Tedros Adhanom, head of the World Health Organisation or WHO,

Because Germany is known as a particularly disciplined country and was therefore to become a role model for the rest of the world - for its strict and of course successful adherence to the corona measures?

Answers to these three questions are urgently needed because the allegedly new and highly dangerous coronavirus has not caused any excess mortality anywhere in the world and certainly not here in Germany; but the anti-corona measures whose only basis are the PCR test results (which are in turn all based on the German Drosten test) have in the meantime caused the loss of innumerable human lives, and have destroyed the economic existence of countless companies and individuals worldwide.

In Australia, for example, people are thrown into prison if they do not wear a mask or do not wear it properly as deemed by the authorities. In the Philippines, people who do not wear a mask, or do not wear it properly in this sense, are getting shot in the head.

Let me first give you a summary of the facts that they present, as they present themselves. Today the most important thing in a lawsuit is to establish the facts; that is, to find out what actually happened. This is because the application of the law always depends on the facts at issue. If I want to prosecute someone for fraud, I cannot do that by presenting the facts of a car accident. So, what happened here regarding the alleged corona pandemic?

The facts laid out below are to a large extent the result of the work of the corona investigative committee. This committee was founded on July 10th by four lawyers in order to determine through hearing expert testimony of international scientists and other experts:

1. How dangerous is the virus really?

2. What is the significance of a post-positive PCR test?

3. What collateral damage has been caused by the corona measures both with respect to the world's population's health, and with respect to the world's economy?

Let me start with a little bit of background information: what happened in May 2019 and then in early 2020, and what happened 12 years earlier with the swine flu, which many of you may have forgotten about.

In May of 2019, the stronger of the two parties which govern Germany in a grand coalition, the CDU, held a congress on global health, apparently at the instigation of important players from the pharmaceutical industry and in the tech industry.

At this congress the usual suspects (you might say) gave their speeches. Angela Merkel was there and the German secretary of health, Jens Spahn, but s"

We are an initiative set up in November 2021 by a group of ambulance workers who support freedom of choice and reject vaccine mandates. NHS100k.com brings together NHS, care, and social work colleagues - vaccinated, half-vaccinated and vaccine free, clinical staff and non-clinical, who are saying NO to a mandate. We stand united in favour of freedom of choice, bodily autonomy and informed consent.

We launched this campaign to support both NHS and care staff who faced losing their jobs if they did not take the Covid vaccine. Our aim along with the support from many other groups was to stop these mandates coming in to force. This was on the background of a severely understaffed NHS, and our desire to have people look beyond covid and to see the impact the narrow covid view gave.

Our campaign successfully resulted in a U-turn with vaccine mandates being revoked on the 15th March 2022. Our team still continue to focus on preventing future mandates from occurring in other areas or ever again. We continue to tackle discrimination in the workplace that occurred during this time that resulted in a huge increase in mental health and wellbeing having an impact on both employeees work and home life. We continue to support many other campaigns who are fighting mask mandates along with supporting the vaccine injured and bereaved which is a subject very important to us.

NHS100K thank all of those involved in the campaign. Importantly we thank all the individuals who found us and stood strong with us to put a stop to these mandates. You are all amazing so THANK YOU!

We are also happy to have launched our own podcast hosted by Matt Taylor, a paramedic who has now resigned from the NHS. Matt has had some fantastic people join him and we hope that it continues to grow and give many a voice. Please visit our YouTube Channel here.

We want to promote ACTION – please see below for a list of actions you can take now to help fight these and future mandates either as an affected member of staff or as a supporter. For more about us and our stance, click here."

This increases the chances of complications, including admission to ICU and premature birth.

With new, more transmissible variants in circulation, it’s really important to keep yourself safe. As well as continuing to wear a mask in public spaces, especially indoors, washing your hands regularly and keeping to social distancing, getting the vaccine is the best way to protect yourself and your baby from the effects of COVID-19.

Make sure you attend all your regular antenatal appointments, including scans. Some appointments may be done over the phone or virtually, but they’re still really important to check on your health and the baby’s progress. If you have any concerns about your pregnancy – including about the baby’s movement – contact your midwife or maternity services.

Try to keep mobile and hydrated to reduce the risk of blood clots in pregnancy, and stay active with regular exercise, like swimming, pilates or yoga. Maintain a healthy balanced diet, and take folic acid and vitamin D supplements to help support a healthy pregnancy.

Key advice for pregnant women during the pandemic:

More information on pregnancy and coronavirus is available on the NHS website.

Q. What effect does coronavirus have on pregnant women?

The vast majority of pregnant women who get COVID-19 will experience only mild or moderate symptoms. However, increasing numbers of pregnant women are being admitted to hospital severely unwell with COVID symptoms, causing complications for themselves and their babies.

Since very early in the pandemic, we’ve known that women in the third trimester of pregnancy are at highest risk of complications due to COVID-19. A study from May 2021 found higher rates of preterm birth, pre-eclampsia, and emergency caesarean delivery study, while an earlier study found one in 10 pregnant women in the UK who were admitted with COVID required admission to intensive care.

Black and Asian women and those from minority ethnic backgrounds are more likely to be admitted to hospital too, as are pregnant women over the age of 35, those who are overweight or obese, and those who have pre-existing medical problems, such as high blood pressure and diabetes.

Q. What research is being done to monitor the effect of coronavirus on pregnant women and their baby?

• The UK is conducting near-real-time surveillance (observation) of women who are hospitalised and test positive for coronavirus during pregnancy, through well-established systems already used by all maternity units – this is the UK Obstetric Surveillance System (UKOSS).

• Imperial College London are also running a surveillance programme (PAN-COVID) to monitor pregnancy and neonatal outcomes for women with coronavirus. Other maternity surveillance programmes are being funded by the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR). You can also ask your maternity team about any local research that is taking place in your area.

• The COVID-19 Symptom Study app has been developed by King’s College London and health science company ZOE. Members of the public, including pregnant women, can use this app to report on their health during the coronavirus pandemic.

• A national survey study, ‘Babies Born Better’, is currently underway. The survey is inviting all women who have given birth in the UK over the last 3 years, including during the COVID-19 pandemic, to understand more about their experiences. The study aims to look at what works best in maternity care, both usually, and during COVID-19. Information about the study that the survey is part of is here. The link to the survey is here.

Q. Should I take Vitamin D supplementation?

Vitamin D supplementation is recommended to all women during pregnancy as it can help reduce the risk of respiratory infections.

There have been some reports that people with low levels of vitamin D are at an increased risk of serious respiratory complications if they develop coronavirus.

However, there is not enough evidence to show that taking vitamin D prevents coronavirus infection or is an effective treatment.

Most people living in northern hemispheres will have low levels of vitamin D and as such, we advise all pregnant women to consider taking 10 micrograms of vitamin D a day to keep your bones and muscles healthy. Vitamin D supplements are available from most pharmacies, supermarkets and other retailers.

Women from Black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds, with melanin pigmented (dark) skin, may be particularly at risk of low levels of vitamin D and are advised to take a higher dose of vitamin D. Speak to your midwife or maternity team if you have any questions about vitamin D supplementation.

Visit the NHS UK website for more information on vitamins in pregnancy and where and how you can access these.

Q. What should I do if I develop symptoms when I am pregnant?

Testing positive for COVID won’t change the level of support you’re given by your midwife, but it might change how that support is given. It may mean that antenatal appointments have to be done over the phone or virtually.

If you’ve had a positive test before you go into labour at the end of your pregnancy, make sure you let your maternity team know before you go to the hospital. That will enable them to put the proper measures in place, including different PPE, and make sure they’ve got everything they need to make sure you and baby are safe.

Q. What should I do if I test positive when I am pregnant?

If you test positive for Coronavirus outside of a hospital setting, you should contact your midwife or maternity team to make them aware of your diagnosis. If you have no symptoms or mild symptoms, you will be advised isolate and recover at home. If you have more severe symptoms, you might be treated in hospital.

Q. What is the travel advice if I am pregnant?

If you are in the UK, you should follow the advice given by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, which is being regularly updated in line with the evolving situation.

Make sure you have adequate insurance arrangements prior to travel and check that your travel insurance will provide cover for birth and care of your newborn baby if you give birth while abroad.

There are differences between the UK countries in relation to quarantine regulations when returning from countries outside the UK, check on your individual country Government websites for your local information.

Q. Should I plan a pregnancy during the coronavirus pandemic?

Becoming pregnant during the coronavirus pandemic is a matter of personal choice. However, you might like to take a look at the Faculty of Reproductive Healthcare (FSRH) website for useful on planning a pregnancy at this time.

Q. What is the advice for women from a Black, Asian or minority ethnic background?

Women from Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds are at higher risk of becoming seriously unwell and being admitted to hospital so it’s important that if you feel your symptoms are worsening or if you are not getting better, you should seek medical help.

Your maternity team may offer you additional appointments, or refer you to a doctor or specialist clinic if there are any concerns about your or your baby’s health.

If you aren’t already, you should consider taking a vitamin D supplementation, which is recommended to all women during pregnancy. There have been some reports that people with low levels of vitamin D are at an increased risk of serious respiratory complications if they develop coronavirus. However, there is not enough evidence to show that taking vitamin D prevents coronavirus infection or is an effective treatment.

Women from BAME backgrounds, with melanin pigmented (dark) skin, may be particularly at risk of low levels of vitamin D and are advised to take a higher dose of vitamin D. Speak to your community midwife or maternity team if you have any questions about vitamin D supplementation.

The Royal College of Midwives has developed new guidance for midwives and maternity support workers to ensure that they are aware of the increased risks for BAME women and can pass on relevant advice and support to the women in their care.

The NHS in England has written to all maternity units in the country calling on them to take four specific actions to minimise the additional risk of coronavirus on BAME women and their babies.

Mental health

Q. How can I protect my mental wellbeing during the pandemic?

We understand that the coronavirus pandemic will inevitably result in an increased amount of anxiety in the general population, and this is likely to be even more so for pregnant women and their families as pregnancy presents an additional period of uncertainty.

Specifically, these anxieties are likely to revolve around:

The virus itself

The impact of social isolation resulting in reduced support from wider family and friends

The potential of reduced household finances

Major changes in antenatal and other NHS care, including appointments being changed from face-to- face to virtual contact

Isolation, bereavement, financial difficulties, insecurity and inability to access support systems are all widely recognised risk factors for mental ill-health. The coronavirus pandemic also increases the risk of domestic abuse or violence.

You should be asked about your mental health at every contact with a health professional. By acknowledging these difficulties, healthcare professionals can help to contain some of these anxieties. If you require support, you should be signposted to resources which can be provided remotely, where possible. If you are experiencing domestic abuse or violence, please disclose this to a healthcare professional who can provide information and support to keep you safe.

Where necessary, women in England can self-refer to local IAPT (Improving Access to Psychological Therapies) services. In Scotland, advice is available from Parentclub and NHS Inform. More information about mental health and pregnancy, including the signs of perinatal depression, is available from the NHS website.

Further information is also available from the following organisations:

Antenatal care

Q. What do I do if I feel unwell or I am worried about my baby during self-isolation?

If you have concerns about the wellbeing of yourself or your unborn baby during your self-isolation period, contact your midwife or, if out-of-hours, your maternity unit. They will provide further advice, including whether you need to attend hospital.

If you are advised to go to the maternity unit or hospital, you will be asked to travel by private transport, or arranged hospital transport and to alert the maternity unit reception once on site before going into the hospital. You will be required to wear a mask or face covering.

Q. Why are changes to antenatal and postnatal care necessary during the coronavirus pandemic?

These changes are a way of ensuring we deliver the best care without overloading our NHS services, which are crucial during the coronavirus pandemic. This helps us to:

Reduce the number of people coming into hospitals where they may come into contact with other people and spread the virus

Ensure staff are not overwhelmed and stretched too far by the additional strain on services, which could be due to staff sickness and self-isolation as well as the higher numbers of patients needing care and overnight hospital stays due to coronavirus

This allows us to care for you and protect you from coronavirus while also ensuring we protect NHS staff and services.

Q. Can I still attend my antenatal appointments if I am in self-isolation?

You should contact your midwife or antenatal clinic to inform them that you are currently in self-isolation for suspected/confirmed coronavirus and ask for advice on going to any antenatal appointments.



It is likely that a virtual appointment will be offered instead, and routine antenatal appointments will be delayed until isolation ends. If your midwife or doctor advises that your appointment cannot wait, the necessary arrangements will be made for you to be seen. For example, you may be asked to attend at a different time, or in a different clinic, to protect others.

Q. How many antenatal appointments will I have?

You will have at least six face-to-face antenatal appointments in total. Where possible, essential scans/tests and routine antenatal care will be offered within a single appointment. This is to prevent multiple journeys and visits to clinics/hospital, and will involve contact with as few staff as possible to prevent the spread of coronavirus to you, your family and other patients/staff.

This may mean that your initial ‘booking in’ appointment will take place at the same time as your 12-week (dating) scan.

You should be asked about your mental health at every appointment, whether in person or via phone/video.

In the third trimester, you should be asked about your baby’s movements at every appointment, whether in person or via phone/video.

All pregnant women should be provided with information about Group B streptococcus (GBS) in pregnancy and newborn babies.

Sometimes, you may need additional antenatal appointments and medical care. This will depend on your individual medical needs. These appointments may be carried out over the phone or via video, provided a physical examination or test is not required. This will enable partners and other family/household members to join you for support and allow social distancing to protect you and your baby from coronavirus.

Q. Will I need to wear a facemask when I attend hospital for antenatal appointments, or to have my baby?

To reduce transmission of coronavirus in hospitals, you and your partner will be asked to wear a face covering or mask when you attend a clinical environment for appointments as stated in the guidance for Scotland and England. All visitors and outpatients, including pregnant women attending antenatal appointments or scans, must always wear face coverings to protect themselves, other women and staff from coronavirus. The same recommendations on face-coverings apply when receiving visits at home.

At present hospital inpatients, including women giving birth, are not required to wear face coverings or masks. The RCM has developed guidance about the wearing of face coverings in labour.

If you live in Wales or Northern Ireland, ask your midwife about the local guidance about face coverings and check on the local Trust or Board websites.

Pregnancy scans

Q. Will I be able to bring someone with me to scans?

In some hospitals and maternity units, there are restrictions on visitors which might mean that birth partners or other supportive companions are not able to attend routine antenatal appointments, including scans, with you.

On 5 June, the NHS’s suspension of hospital visiting was lifted. This means that visiting is now subject to local discretion by Trusts and other NHS bodies – please check with your maternity team and sonography unit for their policy on visitors attending antenatal appointments, including scans. It is important that any visitors and outpatients follow guidance in hospitals about social distancing, wearing a face covering and handwashing.

If you are unable to bring someone with you to your scan, we encourage units to allow women to share the ultrasound scan experience with their partner (or other family members and friends) by saving a short 10–30-second video clip of the baby at the end of the dating scan and/or anomaly scan.

In the current pandemic situation, when women attend alone, virtual attendance by partners or companions by online video call, or the filming of the dating and/or anomaly scan, is not recommended. While we understand this may be disappointing, virtual attendance can be distracting to the sonographer and prevent them from doing their job effectively.

We understand it may be upsetting if you are asked to come alone to a scan, but this measure has been put in place to protect maternity staff, other women and babies, and you and your family from the risk of infection. Scans are an essential part of pregnancy care and it is important that you continue to attend them for your and your baby’s wellbeing.

Childbirth choices

Q. Will being in self-isolation for suspected or confirmed Covid-19 affect my birthplace choices?

If you have COVID symptoms or have tested positive, let your midwife know. When you go into early labour, let your maternity team know and come into the maternity unit rather than stay at home. This is to keep you, and those caring for you, safe.

If you have COVID, or even think you might, Being in the hospital is the safest option for you and your baby. If you have a high temperature, or if you are ill as a result of any infection, including COVID-19, your baby is more likely to show signs of distress in labour. The sort of close, continuous monitoring needed during labour can only be done in hospital.

It’s safer for the midwives and other staff caring for you too. Hospital labour rooms have a specialised deep clean before each admission and midwives have access to the full range of protective equipment. Being in hospital also means that other members of the team are on hand if you need more or different care.

Birth partners

Q. Will I be able to have my birth partner(s) with me during labour and birth?

Yes, you should be encouraged to have at least one well birth partner present with you during labour and birth. Your birth partner(s) must wear a mask in hospital.

Having a trusted birth partner present throughout labour is known to make a significant difference to the safety and wellbeing of women in childbirth.

If a birth partner has symptoms of coronavirus or has recently tested positive for coronavirus, we do not recommend they go into the maternity suite, to safeguard the health of you, other women and babies and the maternity staff supporting you.

In some hospitals and maternity units, restrictions on visiting remain in place which might mean that birth partners or other supportive companions are not able to attend routine antenatal appointments, or stay with women on antenatal or postnatal wards. However, this should not impact on your birth partner’s presence during your labour and the birth, unless they are unwell with coronavirus symptoms or have tested positive for coronavirus.

We know that for some women, their chosen birth partner(s) may be from a different household due to their individual circumstances. You should be supported to have them with you, unless they are unwell with coronavirus symptoms or have tested positive for coronavirus.

Q. Will I be able to have my birth partner(s) with me if I am being induced?

At least one birth partner without symptoms should be able to attend your induction of labour where that is in a single room (e.g. on the maternity suite) but potentially not if the induction takes place in a bay on a main ward, as it may not be possible to maintain the necessary social distancing measures.

On 5 June 2020, the NHS’s suspension of hospital visiting was lifted. This means that visiting is now subject to local discretion by Trusts and other NHS bodies – please check with your maternity team for their policy on visitors to the antenatal ward. It is important that any visitors follow guidance in hospitals about social distancing, wearing a face covering and regular handwashing.

We understand this must be a very worrying and anxious time if you are pregnant and your birth partner(s) cannot be with you while you are being induced. However, hospitals still need to limit the number of visitors during this time.

This guidance is in place to protect other pregnant women and babies and birth partners themselves.

Please be assured that if your birth partner(s) is unable to be with you on a ward during your induction, this will not impact on your birth partner’s presence during labour and the birth, unless they are unwell with symptoms of coronavirus or have tested positive for coronavirus. At the point you go into active labour, you will be moved to your own room and at least one well birth partner will be able to join you.

Q. Will I be able to have a birth partner with me on the postnatal ward?

On 5 June 2020, the NHS’s suspension of hospital visiting was lifted. This means that visiting is now subject to local discretion by trusts and other NHS bodies – please check with your maternity team for their policy on visitors to the postnatal wards.

We understand that not having a birth partner with you on the postnatal ward after you have given birth may be upsetting but these restrictions are in place to reduce the risk of transmission of coronavirus to you, your baby, the maternity staff and birth partners themselves.

Please be reassured that during this time, midwifery, obstetric and support staff will do their best to support the needs of all women and the practical challenges of caring for newborn babies after birth. If visitors are permitted, it is important that they follow guidance in hospitals about social distancing, wearing a face covering and regular handwashing.

Q. What if I decline testing for coronavirus?

If you decline testing for coronavirus prior to attending hospital for urgent or planned maternity care (including labour and birth), your care will be the same as any woman who is admitted to hospital and who does not yet have a test result.

If you have symptoms suggestive of coronavirus you will be treated as potentially having coronavirus.

If you do not have symptoms you will be treated as other asymptomatic women who do not yet have a test result. For most units, this will mean that you are presumed to not have coronavirus.

Wait a minute … that doesn’t sound right – how to spot vaccine misinformation before you share

Do flies spread COVID-19? Can you catch the virus from your shoes? Will adding pepper to your soup protect you? When it comes to COVID-19, there are plenty of interesting theories out there.



False news comes in many forms; social posts which go viral, statements by public figures or things you hear from family and friends. While some claims are easy to ignore, it gets trickier when misinformation starts invading the public consciousness, where it can cause real harm.



One example, which really has taken hold, is the belief that the COVID-19 vaccine affects fertility. Yet scientists have repeatedly explained that there is no scientific reason why any of the vaccines could have this effect.



According to Mohammad Hassan-Ally, clinical lead for COVID-19 vaccinations in Merton: “People who haven’t come forward for their vaccine often fear harm from the jab because they get their information from WhatsApp and Facebook groups. They see videos, supposedly leaked by ‘insiders’ and believe this rather than traditional news outlets.

“The myth of the vaccine containing microchips has been busted – not many people believe that now, but infertility still comes up as a concern. We talk to people about how there is no data to suggest any ill-effects, we try to explain that.”

With so much information about COVID-19 out there, how do you work out what to trust? If you’re not sure about a claim, you can use the government’s SHARE checklist, to examine it more carefully, before you like, retweet or spread the word to family and friends:

What’s the SOURCE?



Be wary of ‘facts’ from anonymous sources – someone’s Uncle Bob, or a friend of a friend. Always rely on official sources for medical and safety information – we’ve listed some at the end of this blog. If a story is meant to be coming from an official source, check back on the organisation’s website to be sure.

Go beyond the HEADLINE



Headlines are there to grab attention, they don’t tell the full story. Always read to the end before you share any stories about COVID-19 and especially vaccines.

Do some ANALYSIS



Don’t take anything at face value – go deeper. If something sounds too odd to be true, it probably is. Check who else is covering the story. If true, it’s likely that a serious or troubling claim would be reported widely across news outlets, so try and verify it with an internet news search.

Has it been RETOUCHED?



Remember that images and videos can often be used out of context or edited and retouched to suggest something misleading.

Look for ERRORS



False new stories on social media and websites can be hidden behind accounts and pages that look familiar, such as the BBC. Check for odd looking URLs and Twitter handles. Bad spelling and poor layouts should also ring alarm bells – official guidance about COVID-19 will have been checked many times.

Always look to trusted sources



For health information including coronavirus and vaccines always check the NHS website and gov.uk. Visit the World Health Organization (WHO) website too, for the global picture.

Or you can ask us anything in person by visiting one of our NHS South West London COVID-19 vaccine walk-in clinics with no obligation to get the jab.

What’s the vaccine uptake in pregnancy? Some 80 000 pregnant women in England had received two doses of the covid-19 vaccine up to 31 October, up from 65 000 at the end of August, says the UK Health Security Agency.1 It’s not possible to say what proportion this is of all pregnant women, as England doesn’t collect data linking vaccinations, pregnancies, and births. But data from Public Health Scotland2 showed that only 15% (615/4069) of women who gave birth in August 2021 were fully vaccinated. Only 23% (165/704) of women aged 35-39 who delivered their baby in August 2021 had received two vaccine doses, compared with 71% of all adults aged 30-39 in the general population.

Why is it so low? Pat O’Brien, consultant obstetrician and vice president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, believes that there are two main drivers. “The first is the natural and understandable reluctance of pregnant women to take anything unusual or new during pregnancy because of fear that it might harm their baby,” he told The BMJ. The second is the initial advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) that pregnant women were better to avoid the covid vaccine unless they were at high risk of serious disease, because of a lack of evidence on safety. This advice changed as new evidence emerged, and the JCVI advised in April 2021 that all pregnant women should be offered the vaccine. O’Brien rejects accusations of mixed messages. “We have more information about the safety of the vaccine in pregnancy, and we have increasingly gained evidence that covid infection is potentially worse in pregnant women than it is in non-pregnant people of the same age,” he said. “The huge difference with covid is that this information usually accumulates over a decade, whereas here it has been compressed into 18 months.”

What are the effects of low uptake? Unvaccinated pregnant women have a substantially higher risk of needing hospital treatment for covid than those who are vaccinated.345 From 1 February to 30 September 2021, 98% of the 1714 pregnant women admitted to hospital with symptomatic covid were unvaccinated, the UK Obstetric Surveillance Study reported. In the third wave of the pandemic in July to September 2021, 13 women who were pregnant or recently pregnant died—more than in the first wave (9 women) or the second wave (11). Marian Knight, professor of maternal and child population health at the University of Oxford’s National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit and a coauthor of the study, told The BMJ that the results provided “clear evidence of the protection of vaccines.” Data suggest that the delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 has a more severe impact in pregnancy. Knight has highlighted that recent data from the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre6 show that in the most recent wave of infection almost a third of women of reproductive age who were admitted to intensive care were either pregnant or recently pregnant, compared with around 12% in pre-pandemic times. Knight, who also co-leads the MBRRACE-UK maternal mortality surveillance programme,7 attributes the deaths of pregnant women to low vaccination rates, the delta variant, and inequitable treatment. “Even though it’s very clear in the RCOG [Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists] guidelines that women should be treated, there is still a very risk averse culture that weighs fetal risk over maternal benefit,” she said.

Will hospital admissions and deaths fall as more women are vaccinated? Experts hope so, but they warn of several barriers. Knight identified the need to tackle “unfounded rumours” about the effect of the vaccine on fertility and menstruation. “All the evidence shows that there is no impact of vaccination on fertility, so it’s a really important message that if you are planning pregnancy, you get vaccinated,” she said. “One would hope that within a year, if uptake among women of reproductive age has matched the rest of the population, I’m not having to count women dying. At the moment, I’m counting women dying every week.” O’Brien said that it was equally important for the JCVI and the government to offer booster doses to all pregnant women. “Many women becoming pregnant now have had both doses over six months ago,” he said. “The majority are under the age of 40, so right now, those pregnant women are not included for a booster dose.”

How have babies been affected by low vaccination rates in pregnancy? A recent study8 found that pregnant women who tested positive for covid-19 at the time of birth were more likely to have pre-eclampsia or to need an emergency caesarean and were twice as likely to have a stillbirth. Since the start of the pandemic about one in five pregnant women admitted to hospital with symptomatic covid have had a premature baby.9 Experts are concerned that the positive effects of vaccination on fetal health have not been widely emphasised or understood. Knight said, “Being born preterm can have lifelong consequences,” adding that preterm births were potentially happening slightly earlier in women who were infected with the delta variant.

How can the NHS increase uptake? Making it as easy as possible for pregnant women to get vaccinated is vital. Knight highlighted that in the initial phase of the vaccine rollout even women who wanted to be vaccinated sometimes had difficulty accessing it. She said that areas where antenatal clinics had offered vaccination, such as in Manchester, uptake rates exceeded 60%. “Offering vaccination at antenatal clinics when women are able to have the conversations around their own individual needs with their midwives and doctors, then and there, will help,” she said. O’Brien suggested that pharmacies could also be used in the longer term. “Doing everything you can to make it convenient is key,” he said.

What role should clinicians be playing? Knight said, “There is an onus on us to be fully apprised of the benefit-risk equation so that we can have those conversations.” She also highlighted the importance of repeat messaging, given the developing evidence. “Women may need several conversations to understand and enable them to make a fully informed choice,” she said. “It’s really important to have those conversations every time women see health professionals.” O’Brien said that clinicians should also be emphasising that the benefits of the vaccine far outweigh any risks to babies. “It protects you against increased risk of serious infection, but it also protects the baby from that additional risk of being born prematurely, which can potentially be serious for the baby as well,” he said.

What else could have made a difference? Knight cites a BMJ editorial she co-wrote in August 2020,10 which argued that excluding women from vaccine trials would leave clinicians in the position of recommending vaccination to pregnant women without evidence of efficacy or safety. “Sadly, that is the position we’ve got into,” she said. “Because of difficulty in interpreting the messaging around vaccination in pregnancy in the early days when there was no evidence . . . that was interpreted as a lack of support [for vaccination]. So, we’ve had extreme vaccine hesitancy among pregnant women and confusion among health professionals as to what they should be advising.” O’Brien agrees, arguing that a tranche of a cohort of pregnant women at lower risk could have been included in the initial trials. “Systematically excluding pregnant women from trials has had a large detrimental effect,” he said.

Analysis showed 198 GBS cases (20 per cent) occurred within six weeks of the first-dose Covid-19 vaccination in England.
Overall, following a first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine there were 5.8 excess GBS cases per million doses of vaccine, equating to an absolute total excess between January-July 2021 of between 98-140 cases.
Data suggest Johnson & Johnson vaccine raises GBS riskRecent data from the US also suggests that the Johnson & Johnson Janssen vaccine - which also uses an adenovirus entry system - raises the risk of GBS to similar levels as the AstraZeneca jab.
“We know that Pfizer and Moderna don’t cause BDS but Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca do and the only commonality link is an adenovirus vector,” added Prof Lunn.","vaccines, scientists, condition, risk, vaccine, gbs, similar, johnson, astrazeneca, vaccination, cases, increase, neurological, serious, adenovirus","The AstraZeneca vaccine may increase the risk of the serious neurological condition Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) with the jab’s Trojan horse delivery system possibly to blame, scientists believe, in a discovery which may apply to similar vaccines.

GBS is a rare condition which causes muscle numbness and pain, and can hinder movement, walking, swallowing and, sometimes, even breathing.

It is commonly caused by the gastroenteritis bug Campylobacter, which has a surface coating which looks slightly human, and so can sometimes trigger the body to attack its own nerves instead of invading germs, leading to GBS.

Now, scientists at University College London (UCL) have found a rise in cases of GBS in the first two to four weeks after the AstraZeneca vaccine, but not in other vaccines, such as Pfizer or Moderna.

Like many vaccines, the Oxford jab uses a weakened chimp adenovirus to deliver the coronavirus spike protein into the body, and scientists have speculated that a reaction to adenovirus may be responsible for the rise in cases.

Adenovirus usually causes the common cold, but scientists are starting to think it may also mimic human cells in a similar way to Campylobacter, confusing the immune system into attacking the body.

Lead author Prof Michael Lunn (UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology) said: “At the moment we don’t know why a vaccine may cause these very small rises in GBS.

“It may be that a non-specific immune activation in susceptible individuals occurs, but if that were the case similar risks might apply to all vaccine types.

“It is therefore logical to suggest that the simian adenovirus vector, often used to develop vaccines, including AstraZeneca’s, may account for the increased risk.”

Unusual spike in GBS reports

Adenovirus-based vaccines are used against a wide variety of pathogens, tuberculosis, HIV and malaria.

GBS affects about 1,500 people in the UK each year and 30 to 40 per cent of cases have no known causes, leading researchers to suspect that adenovirus could be a factor.

During the 1976 swine flu vaccination campaign in the USA, there was a small increase in GBS associated with the flu jab at that time, leading scientists to question whether the Covid jabs could have a similar effect.

To find out, UCL researchers carried out a population-based study of NHS data in England to track GBS case rates against vaccination rollout.

Between January to October 2021, 996 GBS cases were recorded in the UK National Immunoglobulin Database, but there was an unusual spike in GBS reports occurring between March and April 2021.

For these two months there were about 140 cases per month compared to historical rates of about 100 per month - a 40 per cent increase.

Analysis showed 198 GBS cases (20 per cent) occurred within six weeks of the first-dose Covid-19 vaccination in England.

Overall, following a first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine there were 5.8 excess GBS cases per million doses of vaccine, equating to an absolute total excess between January-July 2021 of between 98-140 cases.

The rate is still significantly lower than the one in 1,000 rate of GBS associated with Campylobacter.

Data suggest Johnson & Johnson vaccine raises GBS risk

Recent data from the US also suggests that the Johnson & Johnson Janssen vaccine - which also uses an adenovirus entry system - raises the risk of GBS to similar levels as the AstraZeneca jab.

“We know that Pfizer and Moderna don’t cause BDS but Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca do and the only commonality link is an adenovirus vector,” added Prof Lunn.

“Johnson & Johnson is not the same one because they use a human adenovirus but it’s similar and the implications are broad because adenoviruses are used in quite a lot of vaccines and genetic therapies.

“The benefits from these vaccines and drugs are huge and the risk is tiny and there aren’t that many viral vectors you can use, but it’s good that the public are aware of the risks.

“And theoretically, if we know what virus is causing GBS, we can turn it off and we might be able to prevent disease progression.”

The new research was published in the journal Brain.

Vaccine benefits ‘continue to outweigh potential risks’

An AstraZeneca spokesman said: “Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) has been reported very rarely following vaccination with Vaxzevria. Vaccination of any kind is a known risk factor for GBS and it is noted in the manuscript that the small number of GBS cases appears similar to increases previously seen in other mass vaccination campaigns.

“It should also be noted that in the UK, Vaxzevria had been administered to more people than any other vaccine during the time frame studied in the manuscript.

“The study observes that the small numbers of cases should be compared to how many infections, hospitalisations and deaths our vaccine has prevented due to Covid-19. Current estimates show that globally the vaccine has helped prevent 50 million Covid-19 cases, five million hospitalisations, and to have saved more than one million lives.

“The EMA and other international bodies including the WHO, have all stated that the benefits of vaccination continue to outweigh any potential risks.”"

But how many people have died as a result of a vaccine and why do different sources of data tell a different story? Sarah Caul takes a look at what the data are showing us.

Last month we published our first statistics on the number of fully vaccinated people who had subsequently died from COVID-19. They showed the risk of death involving COVID-19 was consistently lower for people who had received two vaccinations compared to one or no vaccination. However, there has also been some inaccurate speculation about the number of people who have died as a result of an adverse reaction to one of the vaccines.

There are two main sources for obtaining the number of deaths where the vaccine played a part; these are the Yellow Card Scheme by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and death registrations analysis produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), National Records of Scotland (NRS) and Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA).

Both sets of statistics are important but they have different purposes and use different sources.

What is the Yellow Card Scheme?

MHRA’s role is to continually monitor the safety of any medicine or vaccine once they are approved for use. Yellow Card is a website where any member of the public or health professional can report any suspected side effect. This includes deaths, which are reported by others on behalf of the deceased person. As the information is self-reported, it means that the suspected side effects are not always proven and some of the side effects may have occurred regardless of the vaccine.

The usefulness of the Yellow Card Scheme is that anyone can report their symptoms and the information can be provided quickly as it is based on notifications, meaning that people can provide information on a possible side effect as soon as it occurs. A summary of reports about COVID-19 vaccines from the Yellow Card scheme is provided weekly where they further explain the scheme and note the importance that the information is not interpreted as proven side effects.

The COVID-19 vaccination programme led to a very large number of people receiving vaccinations in a relatively short period. Some people will, sadly, die by chance shortly after receiving a vaccine, so the death can be mistakenly attributed to the COVID-19 vaccination by a family member or carer. In the course of such a large-scale programme, this could add up to a large number.

What are death registrations data?

When a death is registered the information, including causes involved in the death, is sent to the different statistical agencies across the UK (ONS, NRS and NISRA).

Doctors are required by law to certify the cause of death ‘to the best of their knowledge and belief’.

That means they use their medical expertise to decide the cause based on symptoms, physical examination, hospital records, laboratory tests, and all the other information available. If the death is certified by a coroner (as it needs further investigation), the Coroner’s Court follows legal rules of evidence when deciding the causes of death. This is slightly different in Scotland where it is investigated by the Procurator Fiscal.

For the vaccine to be mentioned on the death certificate the medical professional certifying the death must have believed, to the best of their knowledge, that the vaccine was part of the events that led to the death.

This information will take longer to come through because deaths that go to a coroner for investigation tend to take longer to be registered. Deaths can take several months to be registered if they are investigated by a coroner.

In Scotland deaths are referred to the Procurator Fiscal rather than a coroner and in these cases the death and a provisional cause must be registered within 8 days and may be updated later after the investigation is complete.

For this reason, we would expect the number of registered deaths to increase, especially for England, Wales and Northern Ireland where there is a lag between when a death occurs and when it is registered. Although this information takes longer to come through, it is the best way to know if the vaccine was part of the chain of events that led to the death.

What numbers are currently available?

The Yellow Card reporting scheme has reported that between 9 December 2020 and 8 September 2021 there were 1,645 deaths where the person died shortly after receiving one of the coronavirus vaccines. This is the number of deaths reported as possibly linked to a vaccine, however they will not have been fully investigated at the time of reporting and a report is not proof of causation. So, the numbers are likely to be a big overestimate. The MHRA follow up all such reports and use other sources of evidence such as the numbers of individuals who would be expected to experience different events irrespective of vaccination.

In contrast, the different statistical agencies have reported that to August 2021 (June 2021 in Northern Ireland) there were 4 deaths in England, 0 deaths in Wales, 4 deaths in Scotland and 1 in Northern Ireland. Of these, 4 in Scotland and 1 in Northern Ireland had the vaccine as the underlying cause of death. This meant that there were 9 deaths in the UK that involved the vaccine (meaning the vaccine contributed to the death), of which 5 had the vaccine as the underlying cause (meaning the vaccine initiated the chain of events directly leading to the death). For these deaths, there was evidence to suggest that the vaccine played a part in the chain of events that led to the death.

Which figures should I use?

The deaths registrations figures published by ONS show the official figures for when a death involved the COVID-19 vaccination, and when the vaccination was the underlying cause. This means it was recorded as such by a doctor or coroner. There is a time lag, for the reasons described here, so the most recent data relate to deaths registered up to the end of August 2021. This time lag should be borne in mind when using these figures.

The Yellow Card Scheme data, by contrast, give an important early warning about possible deaths relating to COVID-19 vaccinations, and form a basis for further investigations. However, the numbers don’t show confirmed cases of deaths linked to the vaccines and should not be used for this purpose. Many of these deaths will actually have had other causes, which explains why these numbers are so much higher than the deaths registrations.

The deaths registrations numbers are likely to rise, as numbers feed through following delays, but they can be expected to remain far lower than those shown in the Yellow Card data."

30 facts you NEED to know: Your Covid Cribsheet

Kit Knightly

We get a lot of e-mails and private messages along these lines “do you have a source for X?” or “can you point me to mask studies?” or “I know I saw a graph for mortality, but I can’t find it anymore”. And we understand, it’s been a long 18 months, and there are so many statistics and numbers to try and keep straight in your head.

So, to deal with all these requests, we decided to make a bullet-pointed and sourced list for all the key points. A one-stop-shop.

Here are key facts and sources about the alleged “pandemic”, that will help you get a grasp on what has happened to the world since January 2020, and help you enlighten any of your friends who might be still trapped in the New Normal fog (click links to skip):

“Covid deaths” – Lockdowns – PCR Tests – “asymptomatic infection” – Ventilators – Masks – Vaccines – Deception & Foreknowledge

*

Part I: “Covid deaths” & mortality

1. The survival rate of “Covid” is over 99%. Government medical experts went out of their way to underline, from the beginning of the pandemic, that the vast majority of the population are not in any danger from Covid.

Almost all studies on the infection-fatality ratio (IFR) of Covid have returned results between 0.04% and 0.5%. Meaning Covid’s survival rate is at least 99.5%.

*

2. There has been NO unusual excess mortality. The press has called 2020 the UK’s “deadliest year since world war two”, but this is misleading because it ignores the massive increase in the population since that time. A more reasonable statistical measure of mortality is Age-Standardised Mortality Rate (ASMR):

By this measure, 2020 isn’t even the worst year for mortality since 2000, In fact since 1943 only 9 years have been better than 2020.

Similarly, in the US the ASMR for 2020 is only at 2004 levels:

For a detailed breakdown of how Covid affected mortality across Western Europe and the US click here. What increases in mortality we have seen could be attributable to non-Covid causes [facts 7, 9 & 19].

*

3. “Covid death” counts are artificially inflated. Countries around the globe have been defining a “Covid death” as a “death by any cause within 28/30/60 days of a positive test”.

Healthcare officials from Italy, Germany, the UK, US, Northern Ireland and others have all admitted to this practice:

Removing any distinction between dying of Covid, and dying of something else after testing positive for Covid will naturally lead to over-counting of “Covid deaths”. British pathologist Dr John Lee was warning of this “substantial over-estimate” as early as last spring. Other mainstream sources have reported it, too.

Considering the huge percentage of “asymptomatic” Covid infections [14], the well-known prevalence of serious comorbidities [fact 4] and the potential for false-positive tests [fact 18], this renders the Covid death numbers an extremely unreliable statistic.

*

4. The vast majority of covid deaths have serious comorbidities. In March 2020, the Italian government published statistics showing 99.2% of their “Covid deaths” had at least one serious comorbidity.

These included cancer, heart disease, dementia, Alzheimer’s, kidney failure and diabetes (among others). Over 50% of them had three or more serious pre-existing conditions.

This pattern has held up in all other countries over the course of the “pandemic”. An October 2020 FOIA request to the UK’s ONS revealed less than 10% of the official “Covid death” count at that time had Covid as the sole cause of death.

*

5. Average age of “Covid death” is greater than the average life expectancy. The average age of a “Covid death” in the UK is 82.5 years. In Italy it’s 86. Germany, 83. Switzerland, 86. Canada, 86. The US, 78, Australia, 82.

In almost all cases the median age of a “Covid death” is higher than the national life expectancy.

As such, for most of the world, the “pandemic” has had little-to-no impact on life expectancy. Contrast this with the Spanish flu, which saw a 28% drop in life expectancy in the US in just over a year. [source]

*

6. Covid mortality exactly mirrors the natural mortality curve. Statistical studies from the UK and India have shown that the curve for “Covid death” follows the curve for expected mortality almost exactly:

The risk of death “from Covid” follows, almost exactly, your background risk of death in general.

The small increase for some of the older age groups can be accounted for by other factors.[facts 7, 9 & 19]

*

7. There has been a massive increase in the use of “unlawful” DNRs. Watchdogs and government agencies have reported huge increases in the use of Do Not Resuscitate Orders (DNRs) over the last twenty months.

In the US, hospitals considered “universal DNRs” for any patient who tested positive for Covid, and whistleblowing nurses have admitted the DNR system was abused in New York.

In the UK there was an “unprecdented” rise in “illegal” DNRs for disabled people, GP surgeries sent out letters to non-terminal patients recommending they sign DNR orders, whilst other doctors signed “blanket DNRs” for entire nursing homes.

A study done by Sheffield Univerisity found over one-third of all “suspected” Covid patients had a DNR attached to their file within 24 hours of hospital admission.

Blanket use of coerced or illegal DNR orders could account for any increases in mortality in 2020/21.[Facts 2 & 6]

*

Part II: Lockdowns

8. Lockdowns do not prevent the spread of disease. There is little to no evidence lockdowns have any impact on limiting “Covid deaths”. If you compare regions that locked down to regions that did not, you can see no pattern at all.

*

9. Lockdowns kill people. There is strong evidence that lockdowns – through social, economic and other public health damage – are deadlier than the “virus”.

Dr David Nabarro, World Health Organization special envoy for Covid-19 described lockdowns as a “global catastrophe” in October 2020:

We in the World Health Organization do not advocate lockdowns as the primary means of control of the virus[…] it seems we may have a doubling of world poverty by next year. We may well have at least a doubling of child malnutrition […] This is a terrible, ghastly global catastrophe.”

A UN report from April 2020 warned of 100,000s of children being killed by the economic impact of lockdowns, while tens of millions more face possible poverty and famine.

Unemployment, poverty, suicide, alcoholism, drug use and other social/mental health crises are spiking all over the world. While missed and delayed surgeries and screenings are going to see increased mortality from heart disease, cancer et al. in the near future.

The impact of lockdown would account for the small increases in excess mortality [Facts 2 & 6]

*

10. Hospitals were never unusually over-burdened. the main argument used to defend lockdowns is that “flattening the curve” would prevent a rapid influx of cases and protect healthcare systems from collapse. But most healthcare systems were never close to collapse at all.

In March 2020 it was reported that hospitals in Spain and Italy were over-flowing with patients, but this happens every flu season. In 2017 Spanish hospitals were at 200% capacity, and 2015 saw patients sleeping in corridors. A JAMA paper from March 2020 found that Italian hospitals “typically run at 85-90% capacity in the winter months”.

In the UK, the NHS is regularly stretched to breaking point over the winter.

As part of their Covid policy, the NHS announced in Spring of 2020 that they would be “re-organizing hospital capacity in new ways to treat Covid and non-Covid patients separately” and that “as result hospitals will experience capacity pressures at lower overall occupancy rates than would previously have been the case.”

This means they removed thousands of beds. During an alleged deadly pandemic, they reduced the maximum occupancy of hospitals. Despite this, the NHS never felt pressure beyond your typical flu season, and at times actually had 4x more empty beds than normal.

In both the UK and US millions were spent on temporary emergency hospitals that were never used.

*

Part III: PCR Tests

11. PCR tests were not designed to diagnose illness. The Reverse-Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test is described in the media as the “gold standard” for Covid diagnosis. But the Nobel Prize-winning inventor of the process never intended it to be used as a diagnostic tool, and said so publicly:

PCR is just a process that allows you to make a whole lot of something out of something. It doesn’t tell you that you are sick, or that the thing that you ended up with was going to hurt you or anything like that.”

*

12. PCR Tests have a history of being inaccurate and unreliable. The “gold standard” PCR tests for Covid are known to produce a lot of false-positive results, by reacting to DNA material that is not specific to Sars-Cov-2.

A Chinese study found the same patient could get two different results from the same test on the same day. In Germany, tests are known to have reacted to common cold viruses. A 2006 study found PCR tests for one virus responded to other viruses too. In 2007, a reliance on PCR tests resulted in an “outbreak” of Whooping Cough that never actually existed. Some tests in the US even reacted to the negative control sample.

The late President of Tanzania, John Magufuli, submitted samples goat, pawpaw and motor oil for PCR testing, all came back positive for the virus.

As early as February of 2020 experts were admitting the test was unreliable. Dr Wang Cheng, president of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences told Chinese state television “The accuracy of the tests is only 30-50%”. The Australian government’s own website claimed “There is limited evidence available to assess the accuracy and clinical utility of available COVID-19 tests.” And a Portuguese court ruled that PCR tests were “unreliable” and should not be used for diagnosis.

You can read detailed breakdowns of the failings of PCR tests here, here and here.

*

13. The CT values of the PCR tests are too high. PCR tests are run in cycles, the number of cycles you use to get your result is known as your “cycle threshold” or CT value. Kary Mullis said: “If you have to go more than 40 cycles[…]there is something seriously wrong with your PCR.”

The MIQE PCR guidelines agree, stating: “[CT] values higher than 40 are suspect because of the implied low efficiency and generally should not be reported,” Dr Fauci himself even admitted anything over 35 cycles is almost never culturable.

Dr Juliet Morrison, virologist at the University of California, Riverside, told the New York Times: Any test with a cycle threshold above 35 is too sensitive…I’m shocked that people would think that 40 [cycles] could represent a positive…A more reasonable cutoff would be 30 to 35″.

In the same article Dr Michael Mina, of the Harvard School of Public Health, said the limit should be 30, and the author goes on to point out that reducing the CT from 40 to 30 would have reduced “covid cases” in some states by as much as 90%.

The CDC’s own data suggests no sample over 33 cycles could be cultured, and Germany’s Robert Koch Institute says nothing over 30 cycles is likely to be infectious.

Despite this, it is known almost all the labs in the US are running their tests at least 37 cycles and sometimes as high as 45. The NHS “standard operating procedure” for PCR tests rules set the limit at 40 cycles.

Based on what we know about the CT values, the majority of PCR test results are at best questionable.

*

14. The World Health Organization (Twice) Admitted PCR tests produced false positives. In December 2020 WHO put out a briefing memo on the PCR process instructing labs to be wary of high CT values causing false positive results:

when specimens return a high Ct value, it means that many cycles were required to detect virus. In some circumstances, the distinction between background noise and actual presence of the target virus is difficult to ascertain.

Then, in January 2021, the WHO released another memo, this time warning that “asymptomatic” positive PCR tests should be re-tested because they might be false positives:

Where test results do not correspond with the clinical presentation, a new specimen should be taken and retested using the same or different NAT technology.

*

15. The scientific basis for Covid tests is questionable. The genome of the Sars-Cov-2 virus was supposedly sequenced by Chinese scientists in December 2019, then published on January 10th 2020. Less than two weeks later, German virologists (Christian Drosten et al.) had allegedly used the genome to create assays for PCR tests.

They wrote a paper, Detection of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by real-time RT-PCR, which was submitted for publication on January 21st 2020, and then accepted on January 22nd. Meaning the paper was allegedly “peer-reviewed” in less than 24 hours. A process that typically takes weeks.

Since then, a consortium of over forty life scientists has petitioned for the withdrawal of the paper, writing a lengthy report detailing 10 major errors in the paper’s methodology.

They have also requested the release of the journal’s peer-review report, to prove the paper really did pass through the peer-review process. The journal has yet to comply.

The Corman-Drosten assays are the root of every Covid PCR test in the world. If the paper is questionable, every PCR test is also questionable.

*

Part IV: “Asymptomatic infection”

16. The majority of Covid infections are “asymptomatic”. From as early as March 2020, studies done in Italy were suggesting 50-75% of positive Covid tests had no symptoms. Another UK study from August 2020 found as much as 86% of “Covid patients” experienced no viral symptoms at all.

It is literally impossible to tell the difference between an “asymptomatic case” and a false-positive test result.

*

17. There is very little evidence supporting the alleged danger of “asymptomatic transmission”. In June 2020, Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, head of the WHO’s emerging diseases and zoonosis unit, said:

From the data we have, it still seems to be rare that an asymptomatic person actually transmits onward to a secondary individual,”

A meta-analysis of Covid studies, published by Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) in December 2020, found that asymptomatic carriers had a less than 1% chance of infecting people within their household. Another study, done on influenza in 2009, found:

…limited evidence to suggest the importance of [asymptomatic] transmission. The role of asymptomatic or presymptomatic influenza-infected individuals in disease transmission may have been overestimated…”

Given the known flaws of the PCR tests, many “asymptomatic cases” may be false positives.[fact 14]

*

Part V: Ventilators

18. Ventilation is NOT a treatment for respiratory viruses. Mechanical ventilation is not, and never has been, recommended treatment for respiratory infection of any kind. In the early days of the pandemic, many doctors came forward questioning the use of ventilators to treat “Covid”.

Writing in The Spectator, Dr Matt Strauss stated:

Ventilators do not cure any disease. They can fill your lungs with air when you find yourself unable to do so yourself. They are associated with lung diseases in the public’s consciousness, but this is not in fact their most common or most appropriate application.

German Pulmonologist Dr Thomas Voshaar, chairman of Association of Pneumatological Clinics said:

When we read the first studies and reports from China and Italy, we immediately asked ourselves why intubation was so common there. This contradicted our clinical experience with viral pneumonia.

Despite this, the WHO, CDC, ECDC and NHS all “recommended” Covid patients be ventilated instead of using non-invasive methods.

This was not a medical policy designed to best treat the patients, but rather to reduce the hypothetical spread of Covid by preventing patients from exhaling aerosol droplets.

*

19. Ventilators killed people. Putting someone on a ventilator who is suffering from influenza, pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or any other condition which restricts breathing or affects the lungs, will not alleviate any of those symptoms. In fact, it will almost certainly make it worse, and will kill many of them.

Intubation tubes are a source of potential a infection known as “ventilator-associated pneumonia”, which studies show affects up to 28% of all people put on ventilators, and kills 20-55% of those infected.

Mechanical ventilation is also damaging to the physical structure of the lungs, resulting in “ventilator-induced lung injury”, which can dramatically impact quality of life, and even result in death.

Experts estimate 40-50% of ventilated patients die, regardless of their disease. Around the world, between 66 and 86% of all “Covid patients” put on ventilators died.

According to the “undercover nurse”, ventilators were being used so improperly in New York, they were destroying patients’ lungs:

This policy was negligence at best, and potentially deliberate murder at worst. This misuse of ventilators could account for any increase in mortality in 2020/21 [Facts 2 & 6]

*

Part VI: Masks

20. Masks don’t work. At least a dozen scientific studies have shown that masks do nothing to stop the spread of respiratory viruses.

One meta-analysis published by the CDC in May 2020 found “no significant reduction in influenza transmission with the use of face masks”.

Another study with over 8000 subjects found masks “did not seem to be effective against laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory infections nor against clinical respiratory infection.”

There are literally too many to quote them all, but you can read them: [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10] Or read a summary by SPR here.

While some studies have been done claiming to show mask do work for Covid, they are all seriously flawed. One relied on self-reported surveys as data. Another was so badly designed a panel of experts demand it be withdrawn. A third was withdrawn after its predictions proved entirely incorrect.

The WHO commissioned their own meta-analysis in the Lancet, but that study looked only at N95 masks and only in hospitals. [For full run down on the bad data in this study click here.]

Aside from scientific evidence, there’s plenty of real-world evidence that masks do nothing to halt the spread of disease.

For example, North Dakota and South Dakota had near-identical case figures, despite one having a mask-mandate and the other not:

In Kansas, counties without mask mandates actually had fewer Covid “cases” than counties with mask mandates. And despite masks being very common in Japan, they had their worst flu outbreak in decades in 2019.

*

21. Masks are bad for your health. Wearing a mask for long periods, wearing the same mask more than once, and other aspects of cloth masks can be bad for your health. A long study on the detrimental effects of mask-wearing was recently published by the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health

Dr. James Meehan reported in August 2020 he was seeing increases in bacterial pneumonia, fungal infections, facial rashes .

Masks are also known to contain plastic microfibers, which damage the lungs when inhaled and may be potentially carcinogenic.

Childen wearing masks encourages mouth-breathing, which results in facial deformities.

People around the world have passed out due to CO2 poisoning while wearing their masks, and some children in China even suffered sudden cardiac arrest.

*

22. Masks are bad for the planet. Millions upon millions of disposable masks have been used per month for over a year. A report from the UN found the Covid19 pandemic will likely result in plastic waste more than doubling in the next few years., and the vast majority of that is face masks.

The report goes on to warn these masks (and other medical waste) will clog sewage and irrigation systems, which will have knock on effects on public health, irrigation and agriculture.

A study from the University of Swansea found “heavy metals and plastic fibres were released when throw-away masks were submerged in water.” These materials are toxic to both people and wildlife.

*

Part VII: Vaccines

23. Covid “vaccines” are totally unprecedented. Before 2020 no successful vaccine against a human coronavirus had ever been developed. Since then we have allegedly made 20 of them in 18 months.

Scientists have been trying to develop a SARS and MERS vaccine for years with little success. Some of the failed SARS vaccines actually caused hypersensitivity to the SARS virus. Meaning that vaccinated mice could potentially get the disease more severely than unvaccinated mice. Another attempt caused liver damage in ferrets.

While traditional vaccines work by exposing the body to a weakened strain of the microorganism responsible for causing the disease, these new Covid vaccines are mRNA vaccines.

mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) vaccines theoretically work by injecting viral mRNA into the body, where it replicates inside your cells and encourages your body to recognise, and make antigens for, the “spike proteins” of the virus. They have been the subject of research since the 1990s, but before 2020 no mRNA vaccine was ever approved for use.

*

24. Vaccines do not confer immunity or prevent transmission. It is readily admitted that Covid “vaccines” do not confer immunity from infection and do not prevent you from passing the disease onto others. Indeed, an article in the British Medical Journal highlighted that the vaccine studies were not designed to even try and assess if the “vaccines” limited transmission.

The vaccine manufacturers themselves, upon releasing the untested mRNA gene therapies, were quite clear their product’s “efficacy” was based on “reducing the severity of symptoms”.

*

25. The vaccines were rushed and have unknown longterm effects. Vaccine development is a slow, laborious process. Usually, from development through testing and finally being approved for public use takes many years. The various vaccines for Covid were all developed and approved in less than a year. Obviously there can be no long-term safety data on chemicals which are less than a year old.

Pfizer even admit this is true in the leaked supply contract between the pharmaceutical giant, and the government of Albania:

the long-term effects and efficacy of the Vaccine are not currently known and that there may be adverse effects of the Vaccine that are not currently known

Further, none of the vaccines have been subject to proper trials. Many of them skipped early-stage trials entirely, and the late-stage human trials have either not been peer-reviewed, have not released their data, will not finish until 2023 or were abandoned after “severe adverse effects”.

*

26. Vaccine manufacturers have been granted legal indemnity should they cause harm. The USA’s Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act (PREP) grants immunity until at least 2024.

The EU’s product licensing law does the same, and there are reports of confidential liability clauses in the contracts the EU signed with vaccine manufacturers.

The UK went even further, granting permanent legal indemnity to the government, and any employees thereof, for any harm done when a patient is being treated for Covid19 or “suspected Covid19”.

Again, the leaked Albanian contract suggests that Pfizer, at least, made this indemnity a standard demand of supplying Covid vaccines:

Purchaser hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Pfizer […] from and against any and all suits, claims, actions, demands, losses, damages, liabilities, settlements, penalties, fines, costs and expenses

*

Part VIII: Deception & Foreknowledge

27. The EU was preparing “vaccine passports” at least a YEAR before the pandemic began. Proposed COVID countermeasures, presented to the public as improvised emergency measures, have existed since before the emergence of the disease.

Two EU documents published in 2018, the “2018 State of Vaccine Confidence” and a technical report titled “Designing and implementing an immunisation information system” discussed the plausibility of an EU-wide vaccination monitoring system.

These documents were combined into the 2019 “Vaccination Roadmap”, which (among other things) established a “feasibility study” on vaccine passports to begin in 2019 and finish in 2021:

This report’s final conclusions were released to the public in September 2019, just a month before Event 201 (below).

*

28. A “training exercise” predicted the pandemic just weeks before it started. In October 2019 the World Economic Forum and Johns Hopkins University held Event 201. This was a training exercise based on a zoonotic coronavirus starting a worldwide pandemic. The exercise was sponsored by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and GAVI the vaccine alliance.

The exercise published its findings and recommendations in November 2019 as a “call to action”. One month later, China recorded their first case of “Covid”.

*

29. Since the beginning of 2020, the Flu has “disappeared”. In the United States, since February 2020, influenza cases have allegedly dropped by over 98%.

It’s not just the US either, globally flu has apparently almost completely disappeared.

Meanwhile, a new disease called “Covid”, which has identical symptoms and a similar mortality rate to influenza, is apparently affecting all the people normally affected by the flu.

*

30. The elite have made fortunes during the pandemic. Since the beginning of lockdown the wealthiest people have become significantly wealthier. Forbes reported that 40 new billionaires have been created “fighting the coronavirus”, with 9 of them being vaccine manufacturers.

Business Insider reported that “billionaires saw their net worth increase by half a trillion dollars” by October 2020.

Clearly that number will be even bigger by now.

This Universal Law is quite simply that: “creatures living together in a group do not as a general rule injure each other”.
Hence, this Law has to be observed by any group of creatures, living at any time, in any possible Universe, or THAT GROUP WILL NOT SURVIVE !
This Law may be applied to any group of creatures, living at any time, anywhere in any conceivable Universe.","creatures, perspective, legislation, global, group, simple, law, universal, politics, care, reasonable, common, living","The objective of this website is to propose a positive, powerful, peaceful and above all PRACTICAL path for humanity's future; so we can work together and create a beautiful, healthy garden, here on Planet Earth, for ourselves and for Future Generations.

The proposed path is:

POWERFUL enough to change peoples' minds in a positive direction. SIMPLE enough for a Child to comprehend.

EFFECTIVE enough to Change the World.

In order to understand this concept, we need to make a distinction

between “LAW” and “legislation”.

A LAW, by definition, is something which cannot be changed . . . whereas legislation, which is written by governments, can be changed by later legislation, or by a <Judicial Review>

For legislation to be LAWFUL it has to be an <enactment of the LAW>

Dr Bonham’s Case, (1610) decided by Sir Edward Coke, chief justice of England’s Court of Common Pleas:

“when an act of parliament is against common right or reason, or repugnant, or impossible to be performed, the common law will control it and adjudge such act to be void.”

Just imagine if there was a Law which could overturn unlawful legislation . . .

well, there is such a Law, and it is called the ""DUTY OF CARE""

~ so the question arises:

“WHAT IS THIS LAW ?

~ what is its history, and what is its meaning in practical terms today ? ? ?”

There is a Universal Law of social behaviour which applies to any group of creatures, living at any time, in any possible universe.

This Universal Law is quite simply that: “creatures living together in a group do not as a general rule injure each other”.

So, exactly how OLD is this ""LAW"" ? ? ?

It first appeared on Earth when two or more single-celled first organisms lived together . . . (we said it was SIMPLE . . . !) If the members of a group were as a general rule to injure each-other, then that group would get smaller and smaller, until eventually there would only be one member left, which is not a group . . .

Hence, this Law has to be observed by any group of creatures, living at any time, in any possible Universe, or THAT GROUP WILL NOT SURVIVE !

It is quite natural in many groups for members to establish a pecking-order, and during this process some injury may be done, but once the pecking-order has been established and each group member knows hir place, very little further conflict is seen.

This Law may be applied to any group of creatures, living at any time, anywhere in any conceivable Universe.

Therefore, if we choose to believe in a Divine Architect who created the Universe, then this is a Universal and Divine Principle Of Law, which any ""REASONABLE PERSON"" HAS TO AGREE WITH.

Even if we do not believe in a Divinity of any kind, the principle still holds good according to both common-sense and simple logic, so atheists, anarchists, and agnostics have to accept it too…

In the Common Law today there is a “Duty of Care” which states that:

“YOU MUST TAKE REASONABLE CARE TO AVOID ACTS OR OMISSIONS,

WHICH YOU CAN REASONABLY FORESEE,

WOULD BE LIKELY TO INJURE YOUR NEIGHBOUR""

This reasonable and LAWFUL standard of care is applied to all persons in every country with a Common Law Jurisdiction including the Government, Corporations, Bankers, and the Legal System itself."

Experts told us repeatedly that leaving large areas of the world unvaccinated and unprotected makes new variants almost inevitable. But big business was put in charge of who got vaccines and who didn’t, so the rich got more than they needed, while the poor got nothing.

The global vaccine rollout has not been so different to how one of Britain’s imperial governments would have handled such a crisis 200 years ago: a heavy dose of racism, combined with the idea that the market should decide who lives and who dies in the world.

Boris Johnson fits the role perfectly. While those at the sharp end of vaccine inequality have been demanding a different way of doing things for well over a year, an incompetent British Prime Minister, educated at the country’s most exclusive school, tells them that they really don’t understand what’s in their own best interests. Then, as now, people may die in their millions, but nothing can shake the arrogance of our rulers that their way is best.

Even in the face of a variant which threatens to undermine the very vaccines themselves, Boris Johnson told the nation on Saturday night that we should be proud of our contribution to the global inoculation programme. The problem, he said with typical imperial arrogance, was nothing to do with the amount of vaccines available, but a product of vaccine hesitancy. Proof, he might as well have said, that there’s no point in giving Africans anything as important as modern medicine, as they have no idea what to do with it. Better to leave it to us.

As so often, Johnson’s remarks have little basis in reality. South Africa, the country which, thankfully, recognised and warned the world about this variant, has only been able to fully vaccinate 24 % of its population. That’s high by the standards of southern Africa. While Botswana and Zimbabwe have managed to vaccinate around 20% each, Malawi and Zambia have fully vaccinated a mere 3% of their people.

Across the continent as a whole, the picture is even bleaker. Fewer than one in ten health workers have been vaccinated, while more people have received a booster in the UK, per head of population, than have had their first shot in Africa. The notion that there are plenty of vaccines everywhere is clearly ludicrous.

It’s true that South Africa has, within the last week or so, received a large batch of doses, and said it has enough right at this moment. Rather than sitting on huge quantities of doses which they can’t immediately use, as UK and most other rich countries are doing, South Africa said they would be more helpful elsewhere. That does not mean that they have been swimming in them for months, or that they will be in three months more. In fact, at the height of South Africa’s last deadly surge, vaccines actually being produced in the country were being shipped to better vaccinated Europe and North America on the instruction of Johnson & Johnson.

And here we arrive at the heart of the problem. ‘Leaving it to the market’ in the global economy means handing decisions over who lives and who dies to enormous corporations. Rather than labelling the dangerous new Covid-19 strain Omicron, it’s been suggested we should call it ‘the Pfizer variant’. That would, at least, contain some honesty as to where the blame for our current predicament lies.

Here, the problem is not, by and large, incompetence. The problem is that there’s money to be made, and lots of it. Leading vaccine producers Moderna, Pfizer, and BioNTech are now raking in $1,000 every second on their Covid vaccines. At least nine people have become new billionaires since the beginning of the pandemic, thanks to the excessive profits these corporations have made on their Covid-related monopolies. Moderna’s CEO become much wealthier just this last weekend, as news of Omicron variant sent their stock spiralling up yet again.

These profits owe little to the social usefulness of those accruing them. The vaccines weren’t invented by the corporations which currently produce them. Moderna’s vaccine was invented entirely thanks to the US government, Astra Zeneca’s thanks to British public and charitable institutions, and Pfizer’s vaccine was created by a biotech company backed by the German state. But in a world where medicine is manufactured by a small handful of corporations in a few countries, that knowhow was then privatised, leaving Big Pharma to decide who to sell to and at what price.

It gets worse. Thanks to a global trade agreement known as TRIPS, pushed in the 1990s by a former Pfizer CEO, these corporations also decide who gets to produce, where, and how much. Which is why, more than a year into this pandemic, we are still producing a fraction of the doses we could make.

Twelve months ago, India and South Africa, backed by most countries in the global south, called on the world to waive these patents for the length of the pandemic, on products, like vaccines, which could bring the pandemic to an end. Pushed by the left of the Democratic Party, even President Biden backed the call in May. The argument was that this would allow the world to mobilise all spare manufacturing capacity to produce Covid-related medicines and equipment. We could have produced billions of extra vaccines by now, except that European governments, including the UK, blocked the proposal.

In addition, the WHO set up a special body into which it encouraged governments and companies to submit any intellectual property and knowhow related to the pandemic. From there they would be able to share that information with the world, turning medical knowledge into a true public good. To date, it only has one submission, a diagnostic tool which was submitted by the Spanish National Research Council last week. Big Pharma sneered at the idea, with Pfizer calling it ‘nonsense’.

Perhaps the greatest irony of the Omicron variant is that its arrival forced the postponement of the World Trade Organisation summit this week—the very body which oversees the trade rules preventing the scale up of vaccine production. At that meeting, Global South countries were again going to make another push for a waiver, while Britain, Switzerland. and the EU were preparing to defend Big Pharma and refuse to accept the need for change.

So obsessed is Britain with the Pfizer-shaped hand of the free market that the government was pushing an alternative proposal to end the pandemic. It included—you guessed it—more trade liberalisation and even more market—lowering tariffs, promoting the deregulation of services, and otherwise closing the space which countries have to respond to this or indeed future pandemics and making it harder for countries in the Global South to nurture their own pharmaceutical industries.

But there is some hope. Fed up with the games of countries like Britain and Germany, Global South countries are fighting back. Backed by the World Health Organisation, South Africa has set up an ‘mRNA hub’ which aims to research the cutting-edge technology behind the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, and produce medicines directly, as well as sharing this technology with the rest of the world. Although Pfizer and Moderna have, shamefully, refused to share their recipe, the hub is going to try to mimic the Moderna vaccine anyway—and produce it without permission.

Given mRNA’s revolutionary potential to inoculate not simply against Covid-19, but to produce vaccines or treatments for HIV, cancers, malaria, and more, this holds out the promise of prising vital technology out of the hands of the profit-obsessed big business, to create a very different medical research system.

So the battle underway goes well beyond this pandemic. Covid-19 has forced the world to question whether our healthcare is a right to be enjoyed by all regardless of wealth, or a commodity to be traded on financial markets for profit. In fact, the rules of the global economy—effectively a system of monopoly capitalism—will not allow us to deal fairly with many of the serious questions we face, from climate change to the threat to our human rights posed by the ever-powerful Big Tech lobby. In this sense, the fledgling experiment in building a Global South pharmaceutical system carries lessons for the type of future economy and society we need to build. And the broad-based movement for a ‘people’s vaccine’ shows how people can be galvanised to fight for such change.

Doubtless Boris Johnson will continue to pontificate about the virtues of free market capitalism on the world stage. But he can’t disguise the reality of the Covid vaccine rollout around the world, now labelled ‘vaccine apartheid’ by many. If Britain continues to stand in the way of a more humane and rational system, countries will not keep talking forever. They will simply start to do things differently. And they deserve our solidarity."
177039,https://wslaw.co.uk/blog/why-long-covid-could-be-classified-as-a-disability/,Analysis of how long COVID's impacts could qualify as a disability.,True,Why long covid could be classified as a disability,"Can long COVID amount to a disability?
Is long COVID considered long term?
The ONS has defined “long COVID”, as symptoms persisting for “more than four weeks” after COVID-19 is first suspected.
Employers therefore should be aware that those groups could bring an indirect discrimination claim based on age, race or sex, where they have been subjected to a detriment because of their long COVID, even when their long COVID does not amount to a disability.
Some have called for long COVID to be automatically deemed as a disability, but this may also be unlikely.","classified, months, employers, long, disability, covid, longterm, cases, daytoday, symptoms, work","Can long COVID amount to a disability?

Under the Equality Act 2010, a disability is a physical or mental impairment that has a ‘substantial’ and ‘long-term’ negative effect on a person’s ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities. ‘Long term’ means that the impairment has lasted or is expected to last for at least 12 months or more, at the time of the alleged acts of discrimination committed. ‘Substantial’ means more than minor or trivial.

Is long COVID considered long term?

The ONS has defined “long COVID”, as symptoms persisting for “more than four weeks” after COVID-19 is first suspected. This would not be long enough for the purposes of the Equality Act 2010, unless the symptoms were expected to last for at least 12 months or more.

ACAS, which has published its own guidance on whether long COVID is to be treated as a disability, has stated that it is currently understood that it is a condition that can last or come and go for “several months” but has not been more specific.

In cases where long COVID has lasted for at least a year, as it has in a large number of self-reported cases, the long-term test would be met and in cases where the symptoms have continued for a few months and look likely to continue, this equally would appear to be met.

Does it adversely affect day-to-day activities?

The ONS reported that long COVID symptoms “adversely affected the day-to-day activities” of 706,000 people, with 211,000 reporting that their ability to undertake their day-to-day activities had been significantly limited. Fatigue was the most common symptom (56%), followed by shortness of breath (40%), loss of smell (32%) and difficulty concentrating (31%). ACAS has also acknowledged that long COVID can affect a person’s ability to carry out day-to-day activities. It will be a question of fact and degree in each case.

What does it mean for employers in practice?

For now, ACAS has not directly answered the question of whether long COVID can amount to a disability and stated that, rather than trying to work out if an employee’s condition is a disability, the employer should focus instead on what reasonable adjustments they can make. This is certainly going to be the answer in the short-term, but what about the long-term outlook?

Hopefully, those employees who have been absent due to long COVID will either eventually fully recover or be able to return to work with reasonable adjustments in place. However, what if their absence is persistent and they are unable to return to work even with reasonable adjustments in place? Employers should proceed with caution with respect to any potential dismissal, as they would in cases of any long-term sickness absence, as it is likely that in those circumstances the employee’s long COVID will amount to a disability.

Medical evidence will likely be key in long COVID cases, as it will assist employers both in terms of deciding what reasonable adjustments should be put in place and to provide an indication as whether the employee is likely to be able to return to work following a long-term absence.

Not just long COVID

Long COVID has been found to affect older people, ethnic minorities and women more severely. Employers therefore should be aware that those groups could bring an indirect discrimination claim based on age, race or sex, where they have been subjected to a detriment because of their long COVID, even when their long COVID does not amount to a disability.

Conclusion

There has been no reported case law on long COVID as yet, but this will undoubtably change in the months and years ahead as we come out of the other side of the pandemic. It remains to be seen whether the Government will take a policy-based approach to limit the number of cases coming through the courts, but this seems unlikely in view of the protections in place under the Equality Act 2010. Some have called for long COVID to be automatically deemed as a disability, but this may also be unlikely.

In any event, it is clear that long COVID could amount to a disability, depending on the circumstances, and it is therefore vital that employers approach any long COVID cases amongst their workforce with caution in order to try to avoid the risk of any allegations of possible discrimination being raised. Compensation in discrimination cases is uncapped but loss-based and in cases of long term ill health this potential risks could prove significant.

Long-Covid should be “recognised as a disability” amid concerns a postcode lottery over care quality will exacerbate health inequalities, delegates at the Royal College of Nursing’s annual Congress heard today.

Nursing staff are concerned that the diagnosis and treatment of long-Covid varies hugely across the UK, with long COVID treated as a physical condition in some clinics but predominantly as a psychological condition in others.

The latest data from the ONS estimates that 2.0 million people live with long-Covid, which it defines as symptoms persisting for more than four weeks after the first suspected coronavirus infection that were not explained by something else.

Woefully inadequate.

The RCN has called the current provision “woefully inadequate” and has called for the UK government to increase its investment in long-Covid research and care significantly.

Mental health nurse Jo Stucke specialising in Covid said, “Some of our patients have really complex physical health problems and their lives have been transformed after COVID. They may be unable to work, socialise and do things that they previously enjoyed doing, contributing to developing depression and anxiety.

During the debate today in Glasgow RCN members applauded as vice-chair of the union’s Trade Union Committee Denise Kelly called for long-Covid to be “recognised as a disability”.

Chair of Long Covid Nurses and Midwives UK Dr Alison Twycross seconds this call by asking for long-Covid to be “recognised as an occupational disease”.

Dr Twycross is also calling for more help and support for healthcare workers suffering with long-Covid, especially when they are looking to return to work.

Understanding of the illness has changed – long COVID was first treated as a respiratory illness which required rehabilitation to repair damage to the body or psychological treatment. Now it is also recognised as a complex, long-term condition.

Increase investment in research.

RCN Professional Lead for Public Health, Helen Donovan, explains: “As nursing staff we see first-hand how life-limiting long COVID can be, especially when patients are suffering with complex chronic symptoms such as fatigue, joint pain and brain fog.

“With over two million sufferers there aren’t enough specialist services to meet the growing demand, and the help patients get varies hugely across the country.

“What’s clear is that the understanding nursing staff have of managing long-term conditions, including pain management, is not being used effectively.

“Ministers must significantly increase investment in long COVID research and support to ensure there are enough services and they are consistent across the UK.”"

Early breast cancer – a cancer that is contained in the breast or axillary lymph nodes and has not spread to another part of the body – is considered curable.
One strategy used to detect breast cancers early is through screening, with the aim of ultimately reducing breast cancer specific mortality.
However, the findings from this study are being contested, contributing to an ongoing global debate around the benefits and harms of cancer screening programmes.
In the UK, breast cancer screening is offered to women between the ages of 50 and 70.","detection, women, early, cancer, breast, screening, uk, prevention, debate, age, treatments, continues","Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women and early detection is known to be vital in reducing the death rate. Early breast cancer – a cancer that is contained in the breast or axillary lymph nodes and has not spread to another part of the body – is considered curable. Earlier detection alongside improvements in treatments and therapies can led to an increased chance of cure in ~70–80% of these early breast cancers. One strategy used to detect breast cancers early is through screening, with the aim of ultimately reducing breast cancer specific mortality.

However, one major harm associated with screening is overdiagnosis and its associated consequences, including unnecessary treatments. Overdiagnosis, in this instance, refers to the detection of cancers on screening, which would not have become clinically apparent in the woman’s lifetime had she not had screening. Finding the balance between the benefits and risks of screening is a heavily researched area, one aspect of which is to determine whether starting screening from a younger age could lead to better a better balance of benefits and harms.

The screening debate

A recently completed long-term study, the UK Age trial, has found that offering breast cancer screening from age 40 – compared to age 50 as is currently offered – would save one life per 1,000 women screened. Their analysis also showed that overdiagnosis did not increase.

However, the findings from this study are being contested, contributing to an ongoing global debate around the benefits and harms of cancer screening programmes. A 2012 independent review, concluded that overall the UK breast screening programmes conferred significant benefit, saving 1,300 lives each year, and should continue. While the review acknowledged the risk and challenge of overdiagnosis, it stated that these were outweighed by the benefits. These findings were highly debated at the time, and the debate continues with some researchers stating that women are being diagnosed with and treated for cancers that otherwise would not have been detected or caused harm.

The UK Age trial has added to the debate and it is likely it will not resolve the issue over whether to initiate screening at age 40 or 50. Although it showed some benefit in the group screened at age 40, overall there was no reduction in mortality at the end of the 23 year follow up period. In addition some argue that this trial does not reflect current circumstances given that recruitment happened in the late 1990s when mammography and subsequent treatments and therapies may not have been as effective as today.

Most developed nations have mammography screening programmes, however recommendations such as the age range and frequency of screening offered to women differ between organisations and countries, demonstrating a lack of consensus. For example, the European Commission recommends screening between the ages of 45 and 74, whereas Canadian guidelines do not recommend screening for women aged 40–49 years but only ages 50–69. In the UK, breast cancer screening is offered to women between the ages of 50 and 70.

Improving prevention and early detection

Woman are still dying of breast cancer and there is more that can be done to improve prevention and early detection. There is continued research that is improving our ongoing understanding of the variability in breast cancer biology, refining risk prediction, and advancing technologies for early detection and treatments. These efforts are allowing for a greater degree of personalisation, which could also have an impact on screening efforts.

Stratified screening is being explored as a potential approach to refining screening beyond the current ‘one size fits all’ model of screening being available to all women in a certain age range. It aims to match the starting age and frequency of screening to the level of breast cancer risk of the individual. In this scenario information on a range of factors such as genetics, family history, lifestyle, environmental, or reproductive history would be used to estimate an individual’s risk.

At PHG Foundation, we have been examining the implications of scientific progress in breast cancer research for broader prevention efforts, including screening. Our work as part of the Collaborative Oncological Gene-environment Study (COGS) examined the organisational, ethical, legal and social issues in stratified screening for breast cancer and improved risk prediction. As part of the B-CAST consortium we have explored if there are opportunities to improve prevention efforts through personalisation. A policy report exploring issues around personalised prevention will be released in the early autumn. Progress has been made in the research arena – translating this information and findings into clinical care, including screening, is now needed."

These 26 new projects total an investment of £5.2m in cancer research projects starting in 2022. This is an increase of £1.6m from 2021 – testament to the incredible generosity of all our Curestarters who have made this possible.

This increase in discovery research will be welcome now more than ever by people affected by cancer, as recent research has shown that funding for this type of cancer research has declined by 25% since 2006. Without the support of our Curestarter community, new ideas couldn’t be pursued and there would be a real risk that the pipeline of new cures for cancer would run dry.

We’re also ecstatic that we’ve been able to once again team up with other research charities to co-fund three projects and make our Curestarter’s donations go even further. The FC-AECC are helping to fund a project in Spain on breast cancer, Cancer Australia are supporting a project in Australia on endometrial cancer, and Pancreatic Cancer UK are helping us fund a project in Glasgow. Thanks to their support, we have been able to kickstart more potential cures that could have been missed.

10 years, 100 discoveries

While this increase in funding is great progress, we have big ambitions to do more. 100 is the number of brilliant new ideas submitted to us each year by researchers around the world – but right now we can only fund a fraction of these.

30-day post-systemic anti-cancer therapy (SACT) mortality analysis

Case-mix adjusted 30-day mortality post-SACT analysis: CMAR workbook (2020, 2021 and 2022 releases)

As a follow-up to our 2016 and 2018 30-day mortality post-SACT releases (information below), we have now published several workbooks containing case-mix adjusted 30 day post-SACT mortality rates for a range of cancer sites, using data reported by NHS trusts in England through their monthly routine SACT data uploads. We plan to continue to release similar workbooks covering a range of cancer sites. The workbooks are also available through a new interactive web app on CancerData.

Latest Toolkit:

The toolkit includes background information, guidance, and FAQs.

February 2022 release: The CMAR workbook below reviews patients diagnosed between 2010 and 2020 being treated with SACT for bowel or breast cancer in 2020 or lung cancer in 2019 or 2020.

February 2022 release: The CMAR workbook below reviews patients diagnosed with follicular lymphoma between 2010 and 2018 who were treated with SACT between January 2017 and November 2020. This is an update to the workbook published in September 2021.

May 2021 release: The CMAR workbook below reviews patients diagnosed with prostate cancer between 2010 and 2018 and treated with SACT in 2018 and 2019.

May 2021 release: The CMAR workbook below reviews patients diagnosed between 2010 and 2018 being treated with SACT for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in 2017 to 2019 and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in 2018 and 2019.

May 2021 release: The CMAR workbook below reviews children, teenagers and young adults (CTYA) (aged 0-24) diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) between 2010 and 2018 and treated with SACT in 2017 and 2019.

November 2020 release: The CMAR workbook below reviews patients diagnosed with bowel, breast, myeloma and ovarian cancer between 2010 and 2018 and treated with SACT in 2018 and 2019 (depending on site).

August 2020 release: The workbook below reviews patients diagnosed with lung, gastric, pancreatic cancer, and cancer of unknown primary (CUP) between 2010 and 2017 and treated with SACT in 2017 and 2018 (depending on the site).

Each workbook is sent to the NHS Trusts for review before it is published, which provides them the opportunity to submit a statement to accompany their data. We have included a copy of these statements in the companion brief for each workbook.

30 day mortality rates post-SACT for each cancer site are displayed on funnel plots in the workbooks; data is also provided in tables. Each diamond on the funnel plot represents an NHS trust; those shown above the upper dotted line (+3 standard deviations) are identified as outliers. The companion briefs provide further information on how to review the funnel plot and a summary table of each trust's position.

Previous publications

National study of 30-day mortality following SACT treatment (2016 release)

In 2016 Public Health England (PHE) published a study on 30 day mortality after systemic anti-cancer therapy for breast and lung cancer in England for 2014 using SACT data. The study was published in the Lancet Oncology and was produced in collaboration with Cancer Research UK. We also published a companion report that provided trust level analyses of the data. Please use the links below to access the publications and workbook.

30 day mortality post-systemic anti-cancer therapy (SACT) workbook (2018 release)

As a follow up to this publication, we worked with our clinical advisors to develop a workbook documenting 30 day mortality rates post-SACT. The workbook contains:

Annual rates of 30 day mortality post-SACT, 2015 and 2016.

A broader range of cancers than the original publication

Crude mortality rates (not risk adjusted)

It was designed as a pilot for a future, routine feed of 30 day mortality rates post-SACT and aims to support clinical practice at NHS trusts. The 2020 and 2021 workbooks were introduced following this piece of work.

This work is based on routine data submitted by hospitals to the SACT dataset. Please note that factors such as differences in patient case mix (which we have not adjusted for), random variation, data ascertainment and quality will all impact on the results. These factors mean that we cannot be certain that a high mortality rate reflects an issue with clinical care. The workbook is not a quality indicator and has been designed to support clinical practice.

As a result we have conducted a “trust notification process” rather than a formal “outlier process” for this report. In the notification process, all trusts received the workbook and were encouraged to review their data. Any results which were above the expected level of variation were highlighted to the appropriate trusts. Trust comments following the notification process are published in the companion briefing.

We are working to expand the reports available on CancerStats to help providers review and compare their use of SACT and the patients receiving treatment. If you have any suggestions for reports which would be value for the future, please email sact@phe.gov.uk.

Other SACT reports

Cumulative SACT data completeness report

The cumulative data completeness report provides an indication of the completeness of SACT data across a 12 month period. This report provides a simple estimate of the quality and completeness of SACT data nationally and by trust and region. In future these data will be captured by the data completeness report on CancerStats. We will continue to make this report publically available once a year for the most recent 12 month period.

The figures in this report hide certain data quality issues and include treatments that are submitted by trusts alongside SACT data that are outside of the scope of the SACT dataset.

Chemotherapy, radiotherapy and tumour resection in England

This report introduces new data on the percentage of tumours diagnosed in England in 2013 to 2014 recorded as receiving radiotherapy, chemotherapy or tumour resection. It examines differences by cancer site and stage at diagnosis. The report and accompanying data are available from the main National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service website.

Data Resource Profile

Data Resource Profile: The Systemic Anti-Cancer Therapy (SACT) Dataset

This publication in the International Journal of Epidemiology gives a detailed insight into the scope and potential of the SACT dataset. It discusses the dataset structure, data items collected, strengths and weaknesses of the dataset and describes how to access the data.

Outlier Management

The SACT team's approach to the handling of outliers mirrors NCRAS Guidance on Handling Outlier Institutions and has been developed from Department of Health and Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership guidance and experience in dealing with these issues. The approach recognises that flexibility is required to account for different circumstances and therefore provides a set of principles to be followed rather than a detailed procedure to cover every eventuality.

NCRAS co-ordinating team can advise on planning for the handling of outliers and may be able to assist with the management of the process. To access the guidance please visit the NCRAS website."

Conclusions robots.txt A robots.txt file is a text file in a simple format which gives information to web robots (such as search engine spiders) about which parts of your website they are and aren't allowed to visit. If you don't have a robots.txt then a web robots will assume that they can go anywhere on your site. This simple robots.txt allows robots access to anywhere on your site. The only advantage of having one of these 'allow all' robots.txt is to stop you getting 404 errors in your log files when the spiders can't find your robots.txt . User-agent: * Disallow: To use you simple place this file at the root of your webserver. So if your website is at http://www.advancedhtml.co.uk/ then the robots.txt must go at http://www.advancedhtml.co.uk/robots.txt . If there are certain parts of your site that you don't want them to visit you can add a Disallow: line. This will stop well behaved robots from accessing the directories you specify. However not all robots are well behaved so don't rely on this as a method of stopping these directories from being indexed. If you don't want pages to be indexed then either don't put them on the web, or use a proper security scheme such as .htaccess password protection. User-agent: * Disallow: /data/ Disallow: /scripts/ You can even disallow all robots from accessing anywhere on your site with this robots.txt . User-agent: * Disallow: / The ' User-agent ' command can be used to restrict the commands to a specific web robots. In my examples I'm using a '*' to apply the commands to all robots. Sitemap linking One final command that you can use that relates to the next section of this page is the ' SITEMAP ' command. This can be used to tell search engines or other robots where your sitemap is located. For example the complete robots.txt could look like this: User-agent: * Disallow: SITEMAP: http://www.advancedhtml.co.uk/sitemap.txt Limitations robots.txt are accessible to everyone so don't use them as a form of security! Although robots are supposed to obey your robots.txt not all of them do. For more information on robots.txt files go to http://www.robotstxt.org/. Sitemaps Whereas robots.txt files are usually used to ask robots to avoid a particular part of your site, a sitemap is used to give the robot a list of pages that it is welcome to visit. By giving the search engine a sitemap you can (hopefully) increase the number of pages that it indexes. As well as telling the search engine the URLs of your pages, the sitemap can also tell the robots when the page was last modified, the pages priority, and how often the page is likely to be updated. Text format There are two main sitemap formats. The simplest is a simple text file listing the full URLs of all your pages. The second is an XML file which can provide a lot more information. For this site I use a simple text file. Here is a shortened version of what it looks like. http://www.advancedhtml.co.uk/ http://www.advancedhtml.co.uk/advancedhtml.htm http://www.advancedhtml.co.uk/addtosearchengine.htm http://www.advancedhtml.co.uk/colours.htm http://www.advancedhtml.co.uk/faq.htm http://www.advancedhtml.co.uk/htaccess.htm http://www.advancedhtml.co.uk/javascript.htm http://www.advancedhtml.co.uk/making-money-from-your-web-site.htm http://www.advancedhtml.co.uk/password.htm http://www.advancedhtml.co.uk/tables.htm http://www.advancedhtml.co.uk/webspace.htm The file format shouldn't need much explanation. It is just a text file with the list of URLs. I save it as sitemap.txt and put it on my webserver at http://www.advancedhtml.co.uk/sitemap.txt . Note that from the robots.txt section I include a line in my robots.txt which points to this sitemap. This allows the search engines to find it more easily. XML format The XML version of the sitemap format looks like that shown below. I would recommend that you generate them using a sitemap generation tool rather than trying to hand code them. Search for sitemap generation tools on Google. I used http://www.xml-sitemaps.com/ to create the below snippet. <?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?> <urlset xmlns=""http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9"" xmlns:xsi=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"" xsi:schemaLocation=""http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9 http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9/sitemap.xsd""> <url> <loc>http://www.advancedhtml.co.uk/</loc> <priority>1.00</priority> <changefreq>weekly</changefreq> </url> <url> <loc>http://www.advancedhtml.co.uk/advancedhtml.htm</loc> <priority>0.80</priority> <changefreq>weekly</changefreq> </url> <url> <loc>http://www.advancedhtml.co.uk/tables.htm</loc> <priority>0.80</priority> <changefreq>weekly</changefreq> </url> <url> <loc>http://www.advancedhtml.co.uk/colours.htm</loc> <priority>0.80</priority> <changefreq>weekly</changefreq> </url> </urlset> You should call your XML sitemap ' sitemap.xml ' and put it at the root of your web server. e.g. http://www.advancedhtml.co.uk/sitemap.xml . Sitemap submission If you add a reference to your sitemap to your robots.txt file then it should be found by the search engines automatically. However you can take a more active role in the sitemap submission process by using tools from Google, Microsoft and Yahoo. You can read more about these tools on my Website Analytics page. Google Webmaster Tools Yahoo Site Explorer Microsoft Webmaster Tools Conclusions robots.txt and sitemap files both serve differing but complementary purposes.

Given that the UK government is now set to scrap plans to allow people to change their legal gender by “self-identifying” as a different sex – while also preparing to set out new safeguards to protect female-only spaces (including refuges and public lavatories), a new Civitas book expresses some optimism for those policies through a series of recommendations.

In this report, Joanna Williams argues public institutions have long been captivated by an “ideology of transgenderism” that is unable to defend the sex-based rights of women or to protect children in society.

The author’s recommendations in the report include:

Both the UK government and the Scottish Parliament should announce a moratorium on all reform of the Gender Recognition Act for at least the duration of this parliament.

The prescribing of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones to anyone under the age of 18 should be immediately prohibited.

No child should be permitted to ‘socially transition’ at school without the permission of their parents.

A powerful political ideology…

In less than two decades “transgender” has gone from “a term representing individuals” and “little used outside of specialist communities”, to “signifying a powerful political ideology driving significant social change.” At the level of the individual, this shift has occurred through the separation of gender from sex, before reclaiming biology through an innate sense of “gender-identity”.

The author argues that this return to biology allows for the formation of a distinct identity group, one that can stake a claim to being persecuted, and depends upon continual validation and confirmation from an external audience. All free and open discussion is a threat to this public validation and is often effectively curtailed.

Joanna Williams suggests that the move of transgenderism from niche to mainstream “tells us more about the rest of society than it does about transgender individuals.” Williams argues: “People in positions of power within the realms of media, education, academia, police, social work, medicine, law, and local and national government have been prepared to coalesce behind the demands of a tiny transgender community.”



The state of play…

In the past few weeks, the Crown Prosecution Service has been forced to pull its LGBT hate crime guidance issued to schools – which had warned schools could face legal action if they did not allow transgender pupils to use their preferred toilets or changing rooms – after a legal challenge was mounted against it. One council has even had to scrap their own guidance urging schools to allow transgender pupils to choose which lavatories they use. In this report, Joanna Williams reveals how this ideology is continuing to make a significant impact across society:

TRANSITIONING: In 2019, the number of 11- and 13-year-olds referred to NHS specialist medical help with transitioning rose by 28 and 30 per cent, respectively, over the previous year.

AGE: The youngest patients have been just three years old.

ARRESTS: Arrests and prosecutions have been made for ‘deliberately misgendering’ through the use of male pronouns.

TOILETS: Transgender pupils have been free to use the toilets and changing rooms that match their gender identity, previously intended only for members of the opposite sex.

PRISONS: Reports of the attacks on women in prisons carried out by transgender inmates suggest that the feelings of transgender women are being placed above the safety of females.

INTERESTS OF CHILD: “…concerns and questions raised by the parents of children who identify as transgender are either overlooked or, worse, seen to run counter to the best interests of their own child.”

PUBERTY BLOCKERS: “…hormone therapies are presented as ‘life saving’ for transgender children struggling to come to terms with their developing bodies yet it seems at best highly simplistic and at worst dangerous to suggest that feeling suicidal is best treated through puberty blockers rather than psychotherapy and anti-depressants.”

WOMEN’S REFUGES: “Clearly, transgender people experiencing violent abuse deserve protection. But the demand that they be accommodated in refuges intended specifically for females again suggests that the feelings of biological males be privileged over and above women who are in a vulnerable situation.”

WOMEN’S SPORTS: “Beyond protecting the physical safety of women, the inclusion of trans women in women’s sports raises issues of inherent fairness.”

ACADEMIC FREEDOM: “In the UK, academics who question the impact gender self-identification has upon women find they are subjected to orchestrated campaigns designed to stop them from speaking on public platforms and to have their publications rejected.”

FREE SPEECH: “The demand from transgender activists is twofold: firstly, the freedom to name themselves and the world as they decree, thereby overriding social and linguistic conventions; and secondly, that other people must obey these decrees and use language that the trans-person prescribes.”

The term transgender often refers to someone who considers that they do not identify strictly to one gender or the other, identifying themselves as either neither fully male, nor female. However they may equally identify as male or female.

The term is also used by many to differentiate themselves from cisgender 'biological' men and women, for example 'transgender woman' or 'transman'. To 'DFAB' (Designated Female at Birth) or 'DMAB' (Designated Male at Birth), or even Gender Non-Binary, who may not identify as male or female and can switch between or rest half-way.

The term 'transgender' includes a number of sub-categories, which, among others, include: transsexual, trans, cross-dresser, gender-non conforming people, transvestite, consciously androgynous people and the term gender dysphoria or 'gender incongruence' is often used by practitioners to explain these tendencies.

We hope you will find this site supportive!

Workplaces are failing menopausal women, change is urgently needed.

Our report, Menopause and the Workplace, sponsored by construction firm Wates Group, delves into women’s experiences at work and is the largest representative survey of menopausal women conducted in the UK.

Our key findings show:

One in ten women who worked during the menopause have left a job due to their symptoms.

Eight out of ten women say their employer hasn’t shared information, trained staff, or put in place a menopause absence policy.

Almost half of women haven’t approached their GPs and three in ten have seen delays in diagnosis.

Only four in ten women were offered HRT in a timely fashion.

Our Calls for Change

Urgent change is needed to harness the skills, experience and talents of menopausal women, so our workplaces don't lose out. We are calling on the Government to:

Require employers to have menopause action plans

Make flexible work the default

Implement a public information campaign and invite every woman in to speak with her GP about menopause at an appropriate age

Ensure GPs receive mandatory training to help diagnose menopause earlier.

So have Ru-Paul and Michelle Visage of Drag-Race fame her-story convinced me to go back to an A cup, and stuffing my bra with socks as they suggest?","implants, way, understanding, claims, ill, michelle, patients, symptoms, really, implant, autoimmune, illness, visage, surgery, job, breast, boob, bii","I want to talk about something which is not very topical, but is close to my heart, quite literally as it turns out.

Cast your mind back to 2019, when few of us had ever worn a face mask, traveling to work during rush hour was still the norm, and in our innocence, we had no idea what a precious commodity toilet roll is. I looked pretty different back then, because in late December of 2019 I had breast augmentation surgery, a cosmetic surgery I had wanted for 20 years, and had finally decided to take the… plunge on.

So, in early 2019 – around the time I was shopping around for surgeons and spending a lot of time standing around clinics topless flashing people I’d just met – my partner and I were watching the season finale of Drag Race (the one where Yvie Oddly stole the crown from Brooke Lynne Hytes #robbed), and one of the series judges, Michelle Visage, gave a passionate speech about her journey with Breast Implant Illness, including her decision to remove her own implants, or ‘explant’.

What is Breast Implant Illness, and why did Visage feel the need to use her platform on an international show to… get it off her chest? Breast Implant Illness (or BII for short) is a systemic complication associated with breast implants, where patients experience a wide variety of autoimmune symptoms – some patients and internet groups report huge lists of symptoms, covering everything from fatigue, headaches, hair loss, depression and weight change all the way to liver, kidney, adrenal and thyroid problems. The list of ‘common’ symptoms is well over 50 items long. However despite more than 80,000 people joining Facebook support groups for BII, it is not a recognised diagnosis, and it was this injustice that Visage sought a platform to fight.

Since 2019, Michelle has spoken about her experiences in many interviews and articles, with a feature-length documentary ‘Explant’ in 2021. But to give a brief summary: she had 3 surgeries in total, her first at 21 and her third set of implants in 2016 – of the latter, she has said, “All along, they were making me sicker and sicker, I believe”.

She was also diagnosed with Hashimotos disease (an autoimmune disorder affecting the thyroid) at 29, but struggled to manage her symptoms. In various articles she describes the need to have breast implants as a ”male-dominated toxic way of thinking”, and her implants as the “biggest invaders in my body” that ”needed to come out”. Michelle also talks in detail about the pressures she felt to get breast implants, as a young entertainer in the 90’s in the PlayBoy bunny and Pamela Anderson era, and from boyfriends who would tease her for having a smaller bust.

Honestly my heart goes out to her, and I wish I could be confident that as a society we’d moved past pressuring people into drastic surgery to meet unattainable beauty standards, but social media is filled with Brazilian butt lifts and young people flying to distant countries to get their teeth filed down and replaced with crowns for a perfect smile, so we probably have some way to go.

Surprisingly, she also speaks positively about her implants saying she is “pro plastic surgery and pro women” and that people should do “what you want to do to make yourself feel a certain way [..] But If you choose to go down that path, just have the information.”

Personally I couldn’t agree more. Everyone considering surgery should be fully informed of the risks, and any good surgeon should inform you of cosmetic risks – such as rippling or asymmetry, as well as more serious risks such as capsular contracture and rupture, infection and even BIA-ALCA, a type of non-Hodgkins lymphoma that can develop following breast implants, which led to the recall of certain types of macro textured breast implants and their ban in France.

So, in the interest of being fully informed, let’s take a closer look at the information Michelle cites in her interviews. She advises her audience to check Healingbreastimplantillness.com for further information, the site of a non-profit called the ‘Healing Breast Implant Illness Society of North America’. Their goal is to:

provide wisdom and emotional support through illness, explant, detoxification and uplift women to overcome society’s false concepts of beauty and over-sexualization.

The organisations’ manifesto doesn’t exactly match up with Michelle’s pro-choice stance, and the sugary pastel-coloured site is filled with images that look straight out of a wellness Instagram account.

Unfortunately, it doesn’t take long before the messaging takes a predictable turn from information to psuedoscience. Right on the front page under the heading: ‘Detox Your Body Get Your Glow Back’ readers are told that:

Breast implants are essentially two permeable bags of toxic chemicals and heavy metals implanted in your chest over fragile organs and glands that leak much earlier than you expect. Having breast implants in your body is not going to end well because everyone is affected by the aggressive chemicals and heavy metals that are associated with silicone and are defined as carcinogenic, cytotoxic, neurotoxic, and endocrine disruptors.

This links to further resources for silicone detox, because it’s a snake oil bingo game with a full house. HealingBreastimplantillness.com promotes Keto, Gerson therapy, the Medical Medium, green juicing, antifungal diets, heavy metal toxicity treatment, turmeric and ozone therapy, to name just a few. It is stacked full of people waiting to take money from desperate people with real symptoms looking for anything to help them.

Throughout the site, the messaging is insistent: Explantation surgery is the only option. At no point are the considerable risks described (there is only reassurance that although explantation adds further toxicity to the system, it is the best way and only way to heal BII), and the content repeatedly ignores and belittles the role of breast augmentation for some people in gaining control of their bodily image. Aside from enhancing quality of life through aesthetics, it can be critical for those getting reconstruction following cancer treatments and for women undergoing gender-affirmation surgeries. To brush it off as unnecessary, vain and toxic seems near-sighted at best.

So, what does the science say? The study often cited by BII advocates is a 2018 cohort study of long-term safety outcomes for patients with breast implants, carried out by researchers at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Researchers compared long-term implant-related outcomes and systemic harms for nearly 100,000 patients with silicone and saline implants from two manufacturers (Allergan and Mentor) with normative data from the general population. The results found an increased rate of autoimmune disorders such as Sjogren’s syndrome, scleroderma, and Rheumatoid arthritis in patients with breast implants, but has the limitation that some of the study data is made up of self-reported questionnaires, and the statistical significance disappears given only 22.7% of self-reported diagnoses could be confirmed.

This might seem sufficient to consider the case for BII closed, and that doctors are right to dismiss their patients as suffering from symptoms that are either unrelated or entirely psychosomatic, but that may be too hasty. A recent literature review: ‘Breast Implant-Associated Immunological Disorders’ published in the Journal of Immunology Research in May this year anaylsed the cohort study alongside 5 other studies, seeking to characterise BII autoimmune disorders and determine possible causes. It concluded that there seems to be an association between autoimmune and systematic symptoms and breast implants in multiple studies over the past decades, but also interestingly, it points out that this association is not limited to breast implants.

So have Ru-Paul and Michelle Visage of Drag-Race fame her-story convinced me to go back to an A cup, and stuffing my bra with socks as they suggest? Probably not.

Association were also be found in other implants, such as orthopaedic implants, even when composed of other materials than the biologically inert (but labelled ‘toxic’ by HealingBreastimplantillness.com) silicone. This review confirms that explantation surgery appears to be the current gold standard for BII, but it’s a prospect that’s hardly feasible for Nana Winni’s new hip. One of the studies analysed indicated that bacterial biofilm is identified at a higher rate in women with BII, and calls for more study in this area.

So have Ru-Paul and Michelle Visage of Drag-Race fame her-story convinced me to go back to an A cup, and stuffing my bra with socks as they suggest? Probably not. But despite being lost in the weeds of wellness-woo, Visage has a point: people are unwell, and there definitely needs to be more research and more awareness of the association between implants and autoimmune disorders. Not just for those undergoing breast augmentation or other cosmetic surgeries, but anyone with medical implants. Hopefully, there will be less drastic and more effective solutions than explantation surgery and green juicing in the near future."

Arla Foods Ingredients, which is part of the huge co-operative Arla Foods, produces its own egg replacement made from whey protein.

And it is telling bakers that they can overcome price volatility and potentially save money in the egg market by ditching eggs in favour of the eggless alternative.

However, Ian Jones, the chairman of British Lion egg processors, says there is simply no replacement for the real thing.

""Egg replacers have never taken off on any significant scale because egg is a lot more versatile and almost always performs better,"" he said.

Food industry observers have been warning that the egg industry should view the rise of alternatives to egg products as a serious challenge.

Professor David Hughes, who is emeritus professor of food marketing at Imperial College, London, and visiting professor at Royal Agricultural University, has warned about the increasing threat from alternative foods.

'Very concerned'

At an International Egg Commission conference in Warsaw, Katherine Bryar, senior global future creations manager at Arla Foods, warned the egg industry that it should be “very concerned” about the threat posed by egg-free alternatives.

She said that the American company Hampton Creek was one of a number of companies developing egg-free alternative products that could threaten the egg market.

Hampton Creek is the company that launched Just Mayo, an egg-free alternative to mayonnaise. The food giant Unilever, the manufacturer of Hellmann’s mayonnaise, originally threatened legal action against Hampton Creek, claiming that the company's labelling was misleading because the product did not contain eggs.

Unilever insisted that Hampton Creek should stop calling its product Just Mayo, remove it from stores and pay Unilever damages worth three times Hampton Creek’s profits. However, Unilever subsequently dropped the legal action.

More recently Hampton Creek has launched an alternative to scrambled eggs. It is made with mung beans. Hampton Creek co-founder and chief executive Josh Tetrick has openly declared his intention to “take hens out of food production.”

'Volatility'

Now, Arla Foods Ingredients is citing recent volatility in the egg market as a reason for bakers to consider egg alternatives.

It said that a number of events had impacted on market conditions. In 2017 and 2018, scares in the US and Europe involving salmonella and the chemical fipronil (a banned chemical found to have been used in a red mite treatment for layers in continental Europe) had caused big fluctuations in supply levels and prices.

Arla said that outbreaks of avian flu in Mexico, America and Asia between 2013 and 2016 had also taken their toll, creating a highly uncertain environment for cake manufacturers in particular.

Looking forward, there were fears that the EU could place import levies on egg powder in 2019, which would most likely exacerbate the situation for bakers, it said.

Arla Foods Ingredients markets Nutrilac - a product that is designed to replace up to 50 per cent of the eggs in a cake recipe. Arla says it is a protein that offers ""a natural, safe and highly functional solution to egg market volatility.""

It guarantees security of supply and stable pricing, thereby delivering greater control over raw material costs, says the company.

Arla said it substituted as many as 300 million eggs last year and expected to record higher levels of demand during the current year.

Aparecido Silveira, industry marketing manager for bakery at Arla Foods Ingredients said: “The benefits of Nutrilac whey protein egg replacers mean that bakers don’t need to put all their eggs in one basket.

“They can better protect themselves against the unpredictability of the global egg market and, in doing so, harness the application and quality gains that our proteins deliver.”

'Real eggs'

But Ian Jones, the chairman of British Lion egg processors, insisted that real eggs were still the best option for bakers.

“Whether food manufacturers need to add richness, increase the volume of cakes or apply a glaze, there is no substitute for the real thing. Egg replacers have never taken off on any significant scale because egg is a lot more versatile and almost always performs better. There are also no long lists of unfamiliar ingredients to add to packaging, which there are with some egg replacers.""

He said prices in the egg market were generally a function of supply and demand, with resultant gentle rises and falls in prices over time.

The UK industry was well placed to meet the rising demand for British eggs, including post-Brexit, when it expected demand for real British eggs to increase further. The industry had, in preparation, already increased the size of the UK flock by more than 15 per cent.

He said many manufacturers had long–term contracts with British Lion egg processors, which guaranteed not only top quality ingredients but also stability of supply."

Schoolchildren are used to eating hot dinners such as fish and chips, spaghetti bolognese and lasagne.

But children at four primary schools in Wales are set to take part in workshops organised by scientists and teachers to inform them about the benefits of eating ‘alternative protein’ like bugs.

These will include plant-based foods and may involve edible insects, depending on whether they have received Novel Foods approval by the Food Standards Agency.

These will be in the form of ‘conventional mince’ which combine plant-based and ‘alternative protein’.

A study in the Journal of Cleaner Production found insect farms emit 75% less carbon than poultry farms.

As people in the UK look towards more sustainable diets, doubters of an insect-based diet will be pleased to know edible bugs are rich in protein, antioxidants, vitamins and other nutrients.

The project starts this week and aims to better understand children’s understanding of ‘alternative proteins’. It will use surveys, workshops, interviews and focus groups to explore this.

Researchers have teamed up with teachers and hope that the four- to 11-year-olds will be willing to try out some of the more exotic foods.

Across Europe, eating alternative sources of protein like insects is already the norm.

A 2020 study by the International Platform of Insects for Food and Feed (IPIFF) found 9 million European consumers had eaten insects in 2019, with this expected to increase to 390 million by 2030.

‘We want the children to think about alternative proteins as real things for now, rather than just as foods for the future, so trying some of these foods is central to the research,’ said Christopher Bear, of Cardiff University.

‘Although edible insects are – for now – not sold widely in the UK, they form part of the diet of around 2 billion people worldwide.

‘Much of this is in parts of the world where they are part of long-standing culinary traditions.

‘And they are increasingly popular elsewhere.’

Researchers and teachers will work together to inform children about the diet (Picture: Getty Images)

The diet is different to the usual school dinners on offer (Picture: Getty Images / iStockphoto)

Verity Jones, of the University of West of England in Bristol is behind the study and said: ‘Everyone eats insects everyday – there’s over 30 parts of bugs in every 100g of chocolate … bread, fruit juices, hops … you name it, you’re eating insects,’ she said.

‘All research, for adults and children, indicates whole insects are off-putting, but ground-up insects within foods are very acceptable.

‘No one likes the idea of having a crunchy bit of wing or antenna between their teeth.

‘But, in fact, children were more likely to choose food containing edible insects over usual meat products on a matter of sustainable credentials if given the option.

‘My research indicates, as with adults, that boys are more likely to be up for trying the new foods first – but overall both boys and girls seem to be willing to have a go in equal measure.’

Carl Evans, headteacher of Roch Community Primary School in Pembrokeshire, which is taking part in the project, said: ‘There is an important connection between our local community, food production and wider global issues surrounding sustainable development.

‘These issues are important to children, but also difficult to make sense of and can often be confusing for them.

The initiative which achieved this included everything from staff training, to the introduction of more durable packing, and optimising the way they operate packaging machines.

""The result was a huge success, with a 70% reduction in waste generation – 1.5 tonnes of packaging per day – with the same processes now being rolled out across all our sites,"" said Dean Holroyd, group technical and sustainability director at ABP. he added that the business achieved its 2020 goals of reduced carbon footprint by 30%, reduce electricity by 40% and reduce water consumption by 50%, much earlier than expected.

Plans included recycling materials from the original building and sourcing Green Grade ‘A’ rated materials for new buildings. The installation of an innovative combined heat and power (CHP) engine is fuelled by by-products – animal fats – recovered on site, together with bio-fuels derived from used cooking oil through Olleco, its resource recovery division.

""We have created a circular economy that reduced our carbon output by 7000 tonnes a year and provided all the site’s hot water and the majority of its electricity requirement,"" said Steve Thompson, category director for ABP.

Packaging also played a major role, having recently moved over to cardboard packaging for steaks as opposed to plastic as a trial for recycling and being better for the environment.

""By reducing food miles, we can be a huge indicator for a future environment. We are not an export nation, we are only 75% self sufficient when it comes to beef and currently we always need imports to meet customer demand,"" said Mr Thompson.

""But it is crucial that government does more to defend against cheap imports – the clear focus should be a level playing field for British products in the British market over imports.

""On the environment, meat produced here has emissions of less than half of the global average and the vast majority of consumers see meat as an important part of a balanced diet. We would rather see energy directed at encouraging the responsible consumption of sustainable meat in the context of a healthy diet,"" he said."

I use SMART on a daily basis, whether it’s looking at my own behaviours, or using the effective tools for life in general. I have learnt a great deal from SMART and I would recommend that you give it a go… What have you got to lose?

When I first came into prison, I knew I had a problem and wanted to do something about it. I was introduced to the SMART Inside Out Programme, which has taught me that I can think differently and change the way I react and behave. I now have everything I need to live a healthy, balanced lifestyle. I support others by passing on what I have learnt in recovery. I no longer feel judged because… I am not powerless, and I won’t be a product of society’s labelling.

After too many years of serious drinking and trying to combat the shakes every morning, some health scares and warnings from doctors, I went into a rehab facility. This was when I found SMART and almost immediately, things started to change. I found that many of my previous behaviours were born from my mostly irrational thoughts but thankfully, I now have the power to change things.

I attended SMART meetings every week and they helped me to feel empowered and finally believe I could recover. SMART gave me tools that I could use to develop better coping strategies. I liked that it was focused on the present, and the support I received from other group members helped to motivate me to move forwards.

The practical nature of the toolset helped me to understand and cope with my feelings. I was encouraged to do the online SMART training which was a huge part of my recovery journey but also, a massive stepping stone for self-discovery of the real me. The support I have found within SMART has been invaluable."

Top tips

Tooth brushing Brush teeth last thing at night and another time during the day. Spit out after brushing. Do not rinse – it washes all the lovely protective flouride off your teeth. For more tooth brushing advice, see our brushing teeth section Fluoride Use a toothpaste containing 1450ppm of fluoride. For ages 0-3 use a smear of toothpaste. For ages 3+ use a pea-sized amount. For more tooth brushing advice, see our brushing teeth section. Eating the right things Try to reduce the frequency and amount of sugary food and drink being eaten. Try to keep sweet things to meal times only. For more advice on the best food for strong teeth, see our healthy snacks section Dental visits Visit the dentist regularly. Children should have a dental check by the age of one year old. To find an NHS dentist visit the NHS.uk website. There is also a contact telephone number for those having trouble finding a dentist: NHS England’s Customer Contact Centre on 0300 311 2233. For emergency dental treatment telephone the NHS service on 111.

Breastfeeding and baby teeth

Breastfeeding provides the best nutrition for babies. From six months of age infants should be introduced to drinking from a free-flow cup. Introducing a free flow cup reduces the potential for young children to suck for long periods of time from bottles. The only drinks to be given in a bottle should be plain milk or plain water. From age one, feeding from a bottle should be discouraged. Sugar should not be added to weaning foods or drinks.

Remember the only safe drinks for teeth are plain milk and plain water.

Dummies

Dummies should never be dipped into sugary liquid and never be used as a permanent replacement for comfort, attention or feeding. From age of one the use of a dummy should be avoided as this can lead to speech development problems.

Teething advice

Babies put their hands in their mouth and dribble in preparation to eat solid foods. However, this stage coincides with teething. During teething you may notice:

more dribbling than usual

red and sore gums where a tooth is coming through

flushed cheek on one side

rubbing one ear

chewing on things more than usual

To give your baby some short-term relief you can give your baby something to chew on, like a teething ring. Avoid giving rusks as they are high in sugar. There is no evidence to support that babies get fever or diarrhoea due to teething. However, if your baby is in pain they can be given sugar-free paracetamol (calpol) or sugar-free ibuprofen.

6+ years

Your child will begin losing their baby teeth around the age of six. The first teeth to be lost are usually the lower and upper front teeth. This is then followed by the eruption of the first big adult teeth at the back (first permanent molars). The last baby tooth is usually lost around the age of 12 years.

Brushing teeth

Brush baby’s teeth as soon as the first tooth appears. Teeth should be brushed twice a day – last thing at night and one other occasion using a smear of fluoride toothpaste containing no less than 1000 parts per million (ppm) of fluoride. It will tell you on the tube how much fluoride the toothpaste contains.

You should supervise tooth brushing until your child is at least 7 years old.

For children less than three years of age use a smear of fluoride toothpaste. For older children use a pea-sized amount.

Tooth brushing games and songs

To make brushing more fun, try out the different tooth brushing songs, games and apps below

Healthy snacks

Try to limit your child’s intake of sugary food/drink. The more often they have these foods the more likely they are to develop dental decay.

Tooth-friendly snacks

Raw vegetables, you could even add a dip

Fresh fruit i.e. a banana

Tinned fruit (in natural juice) with plain natural yoghurt

Pieces of cheese

Crackers/breadsticks

Bread products with low fat spreads i.e. toast, pitta breads, crumpets

Plain popcorn

Sandwiches – fillings could include: cheddar and celery, cream cheese and cucumber, tuna and sweetcorn, ham or chicken, houmous and grated carrots

Drinks

Remember the safest drinks for teeth are plain milk or plain water.

For more information on how to cut down on sugary food and drink click on the Change For Life sugar smart website.

Avoiding smoking

Smoking or chewing tobacco can:

Damage teeth and gums

Cause bad breath

Lead to stained teeth, gum disease and tooth loss

Cause loss of taste and irritate the gums

Both tobacco and alcohol use increases the risk of developing mouth cancer. For advice on how to stop smoking contact Yorkshire Smoke Free Service.

Mouthguards

If your child or young person are involved with any contact sport i.e. rugby or boxing – make sure they wear a mouthguard.

A mouthguard is a protective device for the mouth that covers the teeth and gums to prevent and reduce injury to the teeth, lips and gums.

The best ones are the ones that are made especially for you by a dentist.

Orthodontics

This is a type of treatment that helps to straighten teeth; it can work to improve the appearance, position and function of teeth.

Orthodontic treatment is only available free-of-charge on the NHS for young people who:

are under 18 years old

have a clear clinical need for treatment

Are you having treatment at Wales Fertility Institute?

Wales Fertility Institute offers a full range of assisted reproduction treatments and the highest standard of care.

Our highly qualified team of consultants, embryologists, nurses, laboratory, administration and counselling staff offer a friendly and supportive environment to patients seeking fertility advice and treatment to help them reach their goal of becoming a family.

We understand how many patients have waited for quite some time to be able to access our services. Some patients have been through the secondary care [gynaecology or urology] services prior to being referred into WFI and it may seem that it has taken a lengthy period to obtain referral to our specialised services. Our current waiting time for an initial consultation is approximately 6-8 weeks from the date of receipt of your referral. If we are able to accept your referral ie. you are able to be considered for assisted reproduction treatment based on the commissioners eligibility criteria [CP38 www.whssc.wales.nhs.uk] then your name[s] will be placed on our initial consultation waiting list.

It is important that you inform us immediately of any change in your circumstances including personal details i.e. name, address etc., changes to your relationship status or changes to your clinical requirements. Unfortunately if we are not informed of any changes and this comes to light at consultation, this may have the potential to affect your eligibility for consideration of treatment or could impact on your treatment waiting time.

Once you are offered an appointment to be seen you will then begin the access to treatment pathway – there is no real further wait for treatment from this point and once all relevant or required investigations have been completed [for example, ultrasound scan, semen analysis and blood screening investigations] we will aim to start your treatment within 3-6 weeks.

We understand that the wait for treatment can be a difficult time for patients and once you have been referred into our service and accepted for consideration of treatment you will be able to access the services of our counselling team to help guide you through the process.

Further information regarding support available to patients can be found under the counselling pages."

By doing this, they are discriminating against millions of disabled people on other out of work disability benefits.



Disabled people are experiencing additional costs and risks as a result of COVID-19, but are without the extra support they need to manage these. As a result, people are having to choose between heating their home, or paying for a taxi to go and collect their medication because public transport is too unsafe. They are having to put themselves at risk by going to their local shop because they can't afford the minimum spend needed to get a free food delivery.



Disabled people have been expected to survive on inadequate benefit levels for years. It is unacceptable that now, in a time of national crisis they are being left behind. The Government have, by increasing the rate for some, admitted that people need more financial support. They must now provide a better safety net for everyone.



MP's and over 100 disability organisations have already called on the Government to provide parity between the support given to new benefit claimants, and the millions of people who were already on disability benefits.



Will you sign the petition to ensure people aren't pushed into debt? Will you sign to ensure people's safety?



Don't leave disabled people behind."

A four-year-old girl fighting for her life after being diagnosed with Strep A is now breathing by herself.

Camila Rose Burns’ parents say they are ‘praying for a miracle’ after doctors described her as ‘the poorliest girl in the whole of England’.

In a glimmer of hope, she has now been taken off the ventilator she has been on since November 28.

But she remains in the ICU in a Liverpool children’s hospital and is being heavily medicated as her organs try to recover.

It comes as nine children die from Strep A following a small outbreak of cases across the UK.

While still uncommon, cases of invasive Group A Strep are currently four times higher than normal among children aged between one and four, according to UK Health Security Agency (UKSHA) figures.

Camila is still battling Strep A alongside sepsis and her family won’t know the full impact until she heals, Bolton News reports.

Parents Dean and Kaye have asked people across the UK to ‘please keep praying’ for their daughter.

‘As you can imagine being off the ventilator is a massive improvement, but she is still extremely poorly’, they said.

Dad Dean Burns says doctors described his daughter as ‘the poorliest girl in the whole of England’ (Picture: Sky News)

What is Strep A? Strep A can cause a lot of different illnesses, but tends to start off with a few typical mild symptoms. Strep throat is different from a regular sore throat and the pain can come on very quickly. Symptoms include pain when swallowing, fever, and red and swollen tonsils – sometimes with white patches or streaks of pus. The NHS recommends people see their GP if a sore throat does not improve after a week, if they are worried or if they have a high temperature, or feel hot and shivery, which is the sign of a more serious infection. People with weakened immune systems such as those having chemotherapy should also see a doctor. Impetigo is a skin infection which starts with red sores or blisters that then burst, leaving crusty, golden patches. The infection can be treated with antibiotics. Scarlet fever symptoms are often flu-like, including a high temperature, a sore throat and swollen neck glands. A rash appears 12 to 48 hours later, starting on the chest and stomach and then spreading. A white coating also appears on the tongue which peels, leaving the tongue red, swollen and covered in little bumps (often called ‘strawberry tongue’). Signs of necrotising fasciitis include fever (a high temperature above 38°C), severe pain and swelling, and redness at the wound site. Early signs and symptoms of toxic shock may include fever, dizziness, confusion, low blood pressure, rash and abdominal pain.

‘We have still not made it to the “safety” of being out of intensive care.

‘We are praying for her to continue to get better and for her body to recover so she can get back to playing at home with her family.’

Camila’s dad Dean said her illness was mild at first but suddenly became incredibly serious.

The distraught father said he’s been ‘living in an absolute nightmare’ since she was taken to hospital.

Speaking to Sky News, he previously said: ‘When we got here Monday, they said she’s the poorliest girl in the whole of England.

‘To go from dancing on Friday night with her friends, to a little bit under the weather on Saturday and then a bit more bad on Sunday, she’s basically not the same girl anymore. It’s heartbreaking.’

A GoFundMe has been created for Camila’s parents as they refuse to leave their little girl’s side. So far, it has raised £21,860.

Camilla became incredibly ill after initially only showing mild symptoms (Picture: Sky News)

The family is said to have been ‘overwhelmed’ by the donations from the fundraiser, which was set up by Camila’s auntie Laura Daniels.

Group A Streptococcus is the name given to a type of bacteria sometimes found in the throat or on the skin.

It usually causes mild illness, like a sore throat and skin infection, and most people carry it without any symptoms.

Rarely though, these bacteria can cause severe and life-threatening illness called invasive Group A Streptococcal disease.

At least nine youngsters in the UK have reportedly died from the infection, including a five-year-old in Belfast.

The Streptococcus bacteria is common and “lives with us in harmony” most of the time, but can cause minor illness through to the likes of impetigo and scarlet fever.

In very rare cases, it can move elsewhere in the body and cause life-threatening Invasive Group A Streptococcal (IGAS) infections.

Numbers typically rise during the colder months, and Scottish health chiefs say they’ve been increasing since the start of October.

Since then, at least 13 Scots under 10-years-old have been diagnosed with IGAS infections.

But this is a very small percentage of the approximately 1,200 total cases registered in the same period – which chiefs say is “not unusual” for this time of year.

The experts also say there’s no evidence of a “pronounced spike” in cases, adding that peaks typically happen every few years anyway.

We usually have a ‘peaceful relationship’ with Strep

Professor Steve Turner, consultant paediatrician at Royal Aberdeen Children’s Hospital, says: “Streptococcus is a common bacteria all of us have in our breathing tubes that lives with us in harmony most of time.

“If you get a cold or virus it can upset that peaceful relationship and cause a sore throat.

“More rarely, it can allow bacteria to move into the bloodstream and cause serious illness.”

What are the symptoms of a Strep infection?

Strep infections commonly turn to scarlet fever, which can be treated with antibiotics.

Its typical symptoms are:

Headache

Sore throat

High temperature

Raised pink or purple spots turning into a skin rash, feeling like sandpaper

Prof Turner says more serious symptoms of a Strep illness can include:

Difficult to wake up

Cold arms and legs

Not passing any urine

“We’re very vigilant for it and I can understand why parents may be worried,” he said.

“But parents know their child better than anybody else and are in a really strong position to know if their child is just a bit unwell or really unwell.”

Prof Turner’s advice to parents

He is advising parents concerned about Strep A to, firstly, ensure their children are up-to-date with their vaccinations.

“If your child is unwell with a temperature, give them some paracetamol or ibuprofen to bring down their temperature and a little bit of a sugary drink such as milk or orange juice.

“After about 30-40 minutes, often the child is much better.

“If that improvement doesn’t occur then parents might need to think about calling NHS 24.”

Can you test for strep? Is there an antibiotic shortage?

Meanwhile, NHS Grampian has warned against social media posts suggesting pharmacies can offer testing for Strep A.

It says this is not a routine service.

Concern has also been raised from parents about possible shortages of antibiotics used to treat infections from Strep.

Health Secretary Humza Yousaf says this is not the case – and has received reassuring from head pharmacists on this.

“I struggled to get to work in the mornings as it seemed to take forever for my body to wake up. I would often have to pull over when driving as I couldn't keep my eyes open. The constant pain in my chest was tiring, as was the radiating pain I would get in my right arm. The brain fog became hideous - I would lose words, train of thought and forget things. Typing and completing computer documents or tasks was such a strain and this had never been an issue for me. It felt as if I was losing my mind.”

Andrew Gwynne MP had a similar personal experience:

Many described suffering mental health issues resulting from the condition, including anxieties about the future and prospects of recovery.

""I am suffering from depression and a brain fog that means I cannot remember the smallest of things even what I am doing at that moment. I have no concentration and cannot follow a book or tv program. At the moment I am so depressed and feel that I have no joy in my life and only existing. There has been no help from any medical profession except 'There is nothing we can do'.""

Dr Dan Poulter MP discussed the impact of the condition on mental health:

Many reported issues with diagnosis and treatment due to a lack of medical understanding about the condition.

“So far, I have had multiple CT and MRI scans, been admitted to A&E following routine blood tests, yet the only thing the clinicians and doctors can agree on is that I am suffering from chronic fatigue. To date, I am yet to be referred to a long covid centre. I feel helpless and am conscious of being a burden to the health service due to being passed from pillar to post.”

Layla Moran MP spoke on this subject:

He went on to say that LGBTQ people were “the way you are” because of abusive upbringings and that LGBTQ ways of life were abusive themselves.

That the police are not here to protect the LGBTQ community should go without saying by now but their escalating tactics show cause for concern.","action, member, cult, hate, lgbtq, trans, campaigning, pride, dont, health, officers, community, violence, healthcare, ways, democratic","At Pride Sheffield 2016, members of the Potter’s House Church evangelical cult arrived preaching homo- and transphobic hate only to be driven off-site by a united LGBTQ community – despite threats of arrest from police officers protecting the cult members. This year the cult returned in smaller numbers but were defended by more police who this time went as far as assaulting an Action for Trans Health member who was being harassed by a cult member.

A dyke couple were walking across the field towards T’Other Stage at Pride Sheffield 2017 when they were disturbed by a man from Potters House Church standing on the field by the entrance, speaking through an amplifier, telling people at Pride that they were sinners and needed to change their ways. Three police officers were positioned around the cult member with their backs towards him in a protective formation.

A group of seven non-binary trans people and lesbians walked over together and the cult member directed his words towards them, saying he was praying especially hard for “this particular group of people” to change their ways. He went on to say that LGBTQ people were “the way you are” because of abusive upbringings and that LGBTQ ways of life were abusive themselves. More LGBTQ people joined the crowd, cheering as a lesbian couple kissed next to the homophobe. The cult member outstretched his hand towards the couple, praying for them to convert to a heterosexual Christian lifestyle, at which point one of the dykes turned around and unplugged his microphone.

A large police officer, badge number 401, immediately rushed over and grabbed the non-binary dyke by both wrists, squeezing hard and causing one of their fingers to bleed. Five more officers crowded around while the officer gripped onto the dyke’s wrists until they managed to break free and began filming on their phone. None of the officers showed the same aggression towards the cult member who had been projecting his homophobic, transphobic harassment over a loudspeaker. Several of them repeated that “he has the right to express his views” but LGBTQ people protesting would be arrested for breach of the peace if they did not move on.

A woman got out her phone, announcing, “telling us to move on is not solving the problem, it’s pretending the problem hasn’t existed. I’m currently recording this as a hate crime.” A man called Darren identified himself as the event manager and tried to discourage her from doing so, along with a blonde haired police officer, whose badge number was not visible, who replied, “you don’t have to, you don’t have to listen to it.”

Darren spoke to the crowd of gathered LGBTQ people, encouraging them to “go into the event and enjoy the day. Ignore this man. Ignore him. We had 20 people turn up last year” – referring to when Potter’s House Church turned up at Pride Sheffield 2016 but were forced off-site by the LGBTQ community working together in solidarity. When the crowd responded that “one is too many” and “I don’t wanna be told I gotta change by any one person”, Darren replied, “we will always have hatred”, becoming frustrated, finishing, “if you want to possibly be arrested and ruin our day, go ahead” and walking away. A group of LGBTQ young people rushed up, checked if people were ok and congratulated the non-binary dyke for unplugging the hate preacher’s microphone, showing far more care for their community than Pride organisers or the smug bystander pontificating about free speech had.

That the police are not here to protect the LGBTQ community should go without saying by now but their escalating tactics show cause for concern. The LGBTQ community showed our ability to defend ourselves against homophobes and transphobes last year, despite police attempts to facilitate uninterrupted hate speech. Although they were disinvited by Pride organisers because of their homophobic and transphobic behaviour, this year police multiplied their numbers, displayed their eagerness to physically harm LGBTQ people and even brought two armed officers. The claim was that these two officers were there in case of terror attacks but the only violence towards people at Pride was coming from police. The two armed officers were preoccupied with showing off their cars to small children; the only purpose of them being there was to normalise the militarisation of the police. Their presence made some LGBTQ people feel so unsafe they left the event which was supposed to be for them.

Police don’t make people safe from transphobia and homophobia, it’s up to us to look out for each other. The police have a monopoly on violence which they use with most force against those in our community who are poor, black, disabled and people of colour. LGBTQ people who defend ourselves from oppression are faced with further violence and incarceration.

No pride in police, no police in pride!

These values can vary depending on age, metabolism and levels of physical activity, among other things. Lots of food and drink portion sizes have been getting bigger in recent years.

Eating bigger portions can lead to increases in waistlines and body weight for adults and children. It is therefore really important to make healthier food choices and be mindful of portion size. Choosing healthier foods and drinks can make you look and feel better as well as making a big difference to your health.

Being more active is also really important. Together these changes can help protect against obesity and help you manage your weight. This is important as being overweight or obesity increases the risk of developing serious health conditions, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease and some cancers.

To see if unwanted weight could be putting your health at risk, check out your body mass index (BMI) and waist measurement. Remember if you have put on weight, the good news is you can do something about it.

This ambitious goal has sparked debate about which measures will drastically reduce tobacco use and sales of tobacco products. One option is the introduction of a tobacco license scheme. A new study in Scotland from the SPECTRUM team shows that the introduction of a tobacco license scheme has the potential to disincentivise tobacco sales and reduce the availability of tobacco products.

In 2010, the Scottish Government introduced a registration system that was mandatory for businesses selling tobacco. However, there is no cost associated with registering to sell tobacco products. One option for helping to meet the smoke-free generation target is the introduction of a tobacco licensing scheme in Scotland.

A tobacco retail license is a regulatory mechanism that requires retailers to purchase a special license to legally sell tobacco products. Tobacco license schemes are crucial for monitoring sales of tobacco products, reducing illicit sales, and enforcing regulations such as sales prohibition to minors. By charging fees to obtain a license can increase the cost of selling tobacco, making the product more expensive for consumers and less profitable for retailers. Consequently, this can lead to reduced tobacco product availability as retailers may choose to diversify their business models away from tobacco. A tobacco retailer reduction has been widely associated with lower smoking prevalence and fewer tobacco-attributable diseases.

However, the implementation of license fees has faced challenges from retailers and the tobacco industry, who raise concerns about their impact on business profitability. Retailers also provide essential local services and if the introduction of a tobacco license fee undermines the viability of the business, then this could negatively impact local communities. Therefore, the public health benefits of fee-based license systems that reduces tobacco availability have to be considered against the potential financial impacts on retailers.

Although many countries worldwide have considered different forms of license schemes, little is known about the effectiveness of these different schemes in disincentivising tobacco sales and their financial impacts on retailers.

Simulating the implementation of a tobacco license fee in Scotland: a case of study

As part of the SPECTRUM Consortium we addressed this question by analysing data from over one million commercial transactions across 179 smaller retailers (convenience stores) in Scotland between 2019 and 2022. We found that stores generate an annual median of £15,859 revenue from tobacco sales. Retailers in the most deprived areas of Scotland received 1.6 times more revenue than those in low-deprivation neighbourhoods. Moreover, urban retailers obtained 2.3 times higher revenues than rural stores (see table 1 below).

All Retailers High deprived areas Medium deprived areas Low deprived areas Urban areas Rural areas Median Gross Revenues £15,859 £18,403 £17,694 £11,609 £18,247 £7,638 Table 1. Baseline annual median revenues from tobacco sales among retailers by area types within 2019 and 2022.

We found that the magnitude of the financial impacts of schemes on Scottish retailers varied in relation to the level at which the fee was set. For instance, adopting a low license fee similar to the one operating in New Brunswick, Canada, (a universal fee of CA$50/year, approximately £29/year), would result in a median tobacco revenue reduction of 0.18% among retailers in Scotland. However, if following Finland’s example of requiring a universal fee of €500/year (approximately £428/year) smaller retailers in Scotland would see their revenues reduced by 2.70% (see table 2 below). In both cases, the impacts of these licenses’ fees may not deter tobacco sales. In order to achieve a significant revenues reduction, such as a 30% reduction, would require a universal fee to be set at £4,758/year, which is substantially higher than those currently active in other countries.

Additionally, our results showed that each scheme type impacted differently on retailers located in different types of areas of the country. Universal and urban/rural flat fees would result in higher revenues reductions for retailers in low deprivation areas. Using a high-level universal fee (similar to Finland), results in a revenue reduction of 3.61% in low deprivation areas. This decline is more significant than the 2.70% reduction observed in high deprivation neighbourhoods. In contrast, volumetric schemes would lead to similar percent revenue reductions across all retailers.

Implications for Tobacco Control policies

These findings have implications for how we develop our approach to reducing tobacco harms in Scotland. Our study showed the potential of license fee schemes to disincentivise tobacco sales as they effectively increase the cost of selling tobacco. However, to significantly impact tobacco revenues and encourage retailers to diversify their business models away from tobacco sales, this policy would necessitate the implementation of relatively high-level fees.

The study described unequal financial impacts from each license scheme among retailers. The effectiveness of universal and urban/rural flat fees to reduce tobacco outlet availability could be questioned, as they would have a lower impact on retailers in high deprivation areas. These areas are typically targeted in tobacco control efforts since they present the highest densities of tobacco retailers and the worst smoking outcomes.

In contrast, volumetric fees could ensure an equal reduction of tobacco revenues across all retailers. Nevertheless, retailers with greater sales volume, more diversified business models (large retailers and supermarkets) or located in more profitable neighbourhoods (ie, urban areas) might have greater financial resources to cope with a given loss of 10% of their profits compared with other retailers.

Policymakers should carefully design and implement policies that maximise a reduction in tobacco outlet availability in all areas to mitigate smoking-related harms without threatening retail viability. One possible strategy in Scotland might include a modest flat fee, considering a lower fee in rural areas where retailers might be more vulnerable to potential shutdowns (ie, urban/rural scheme), along with an additional moderate volumetric fee.

To help prevent further deaths, the charity says everyone with a learning disability must urgently be included in group 6 on the vaccine A vaccine is medicine that helps your body to fight an infection in the future. priority list.

The data from LeDeR and the Office for National Statistics (ONS) also shows that in every week since the end of November, people with a learning disability have died from COVID disproportionately from the general population. And as the second wave continues to unfold, the disparity between the proportion of COVID deaths has grown dramatically throughout December and January.

Despite these shocking figures – and previous data from Public Health England showing people with a learning disability in England are dying from COVID-19 at six times the rate of the general population – not everyone with a learning disability is being prioritised for the COVID vaccine [iv].

Currently those with a severe or profound learning disability and adults with Down’s syndrome are on the priority list, but people with a mild or moderate learning disability are not being prioritised at all (unless they have other conditions that mean they’re included in the priority list).

Yet further data shows that 65% of those with a learning disability who died from COVID in the first wave in England had a mild or moderate disability [v].

Many are also dying much younger – further data from Public Health England shows younger adults aged 18-34 with a learning disability are 30 times more likely to die of COVID than young adults in the general population [vi].

Even before COVID-19, people with a learning disability faced serious health inequalities and had a significantly lower life expectancy – with women dying on average 27 years younger and men dying 22 years younger [vii].

Including all people with a learning disability in at least priority group 6 would enable a smoother vaccine rollout. There is currently no required or consistent way of identifying and recording what constitutes a mild, moderate or severe learning disability on GP learning disability registers.

Having to categorise patients in order to prioritise them could lead to confusion over who is eligible, would add extra strain on overwhelmed medical professionals to categorise them, and ultimately mean people miss out and their lives are put at risk. Mencap estimates that including all people with a learning disability in group 6 would only be an additional 100,000-200,000 people, so would not overwhelm the rollout of the vaccine [viii].

Harry Roche, Communications Assistant and Ambassador at Mencap and who has a learning disability, said: “The death rate for 18-34-year-olds with a learning disability is 30 times higher than the rest of the population. I’m 32 years old and have a learning disability - this statistic scares me. I’m calling on Boris Johnson and Matt Hancock to rethink and prioritise everyone with a learning disability. We are too often forgotten, don’t ignore us now.”

Dan Scorer, Head of Policy at the learning disability Mencap, said: “People with a learning disability have long been forgotten and discriminated against, and never more so than in this crisis. They have died at greater rates, had Do-Not-Resuscitate (DNR) orders slapped on their files and suffered through severe isolation. The services and support they rely on have been removed and their physical and mental health has suffered – many are struggling to cope. “The Government is not acting on the clear evidence that all people with a learning disability are highly vulnerable to dying from COVID-19, not only those already included in vaccine priority groups. While age is understandably the key determinant in the priority list, it doesn’t take account of the fact that a person with a learning disability dies on average over 20 years younger than the general population. Ultimately the JCVI’s medical approach to the priority list is flawed and fails to consider a host of social, economic and health inequalities. We are urgently calling for everyone with a learning disability – who are among the most vulnerable in society to dying from COVID - to be prioritised in group 6 for the vaccine.”

These figures are based on deaths reported to the Disabilities Mortality Review (LeDeR) programme, and deaths in hospitals from NHS England’s COVID-19 Patient Notification System (CPNS) and are adjusted for under-reporting. Standardising for age and sex, the rate of COVID-19 deaths notified to LeDeR, from 21st March to 5th June 2020, was 4.1 times the rate for the general population of England. Adjusting this for under-reporting, the rate is estimated at 6.3 times the general population rate.

Using rates calculated only from reports to LeDeR, the rate was 30 times the rate for the general population at ages 18 to 34.

[v] University of Bristol (2020). Deaths of people with a learning disability from COVID-19.

Adult deaths notified to LeDeR with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 and who died between 2nd March – 9th June 2020, shows that 65% of people had a mild or moderate learning disability.

[vii] University of Bristol (2020) The Learning Disability Mortality Review (LeDeR) Programme Annual report 2019.

LeDeR’s report shows that people with a learning disability died from an avoidable medical cause of death twice as frequently as people in the general population (44% of deaths of people with a learning disability; 22% of deaths in the general population). And data also suggests that the disparity between the age at death for people with a learning disability (age 4 years and over) and the general population (all ages) in 2019 was 22 years for males and 27 years for females.

[viii] Mencap has estimated that the numbers will not impact the further roll out of the vaccine to other groups or key workers:

In England, there are 900,000 adults with a learning disability

224,000 are 65+

25,000-27,000 people with Down’s Syndrome are estimated to be over 18, and are therefore in priority group 4

Up to 350,000 people have a severe learning disability and therefore should be in priority group 6 (Source: NHS site)

This leaves 301,000, but this will be much lower when you factor in that people with a learning disability have a high proportion of other serious health issues. For example, they are around twice as likely to have diabetes (mainly type 2) as the general population. They also have higher rates of obesity, heart disease and also serious mental health issues. All these conditions would mean they’re included priority group 6 already. Mencap estimates that prioritising everyone in group 6 would mean adding a further 100-200,000 people to the list.

The Impact of COVID-19 on People with Chronic Illness

Authors: Dr Anna Ruddock and Dr Anna Gkiouleka

The Chronic Illness Inclusion Project (CIIP) is in the process of becoming a user-led advocacy organisation for people living with energy limiting chronic illness. The CIIP began as a social action research project led by disabled people that ran from April 2017 to December 2019. It was part of the DRILL programme of disability research and continues to be supported by the Centre for Welfare Reform.

The CIIP investigated the lived experience of people with chronic illness in the UK. The majority of its research participants live with “stamina, breathing and fatigue” impairments, which constitute the second largest impairment group in the UK (2017 Family Resources Survey). The CIIP's research is the only one of its kind to represent this important sub-group of disabled people within the UK population. Its research findings and associated policy recommendations are contained in the report: Energy impairment and disability inclusion: towards an advocacy movement for energy limiting chronic illness.

In response to the call for evidence by the Women and Equalities Committee, we conducted a survey between 15-24 April 2020 to ask about the impact of coronavirus and associated policies on people with chronic illness. The survey was open to anyone based in the UK living with at least one chronic condition. This evidence brief is based on 776 responses.

Welsh national disability organisations raise concerns about the impact on disabled people living with pre-existing medical conditions

Disability Wales, All Wales People First, Wales Council of the Blind, All Wales Parents and Carers Forum, Learning Disability Wales and Mencap Cymru call on the UK and Welsh Governments to act decisively to safeguard the well-being and survival of disabled people and others categorised as being at high risk of contracting the virus in the face of a Covid-19 pandemic. We are extremely concerned that necessary measures to minimise fatalities in these groups are not being taken.

In particular we are concerned that:

The NHS in both England and Wales is already underfunded and struggling to keep up with demand. This means that in the case of a mass outbreak, NHS workers will not be able to provide adequate care for all patients. Reports from Italy, where the pandemic is in a more advanced stage, are extremely troubling. We note that in Italy some people are already not receiving treatment due to lack of resources. The UK Government and Welsh Government must do everything in their power now to prevent similar decisions being made here at the height of the pandemic.

For disabled people, much of the advice on how to avoid infection (eg self-isolation, social distancing) is impossible to follow particularly for those who require daily assistance and likewise for people employed as personal assistants (PAs) or care and support workers. The UK Government and Welsh Government must act quickly to offer support both to disabled people who require PAs or care and support workers to provide daily support and also to the PAs and carers themselves.

Many care and support providers have been financially impacted following 10 years of austerity measures resulting in an overstretched workforce. We are concerned about the quality of care that can be delivered when care workers go into isolation or become sick. Both the UK and Welsh Government must urgently put co-ordinated plans into place on how to respond to a shortage of care workers. In particular, care providers must be given substantial financial support now in order to recruit additional carers and be able to offer these care workers good wages.

Taken together these factors lead us to believe that disabled people are likely to face harm not just through the Coronavirus itself but through the general strain on the health and social care system as well as wider societal barriers. The UK Government has announced £5 billion in emergency funding for public services to alleviate the pressures resulting from the Coronavirus.

As organisations representing the interests of disabled people, we call for urgent support from this fund to ensure social care delivery and provision or accessible information and support is adequately resourced in Wales. We urge both the UK and Welsh Governments to intervene urgently to ensure disabled people are not treated as unavoidable casualties in this pandemic.

Ymateb ar y cyd i’r achosion o Coronafeirws ar draws Cymru

Mae cyrff anabledd cenedlaethol yng Nghymru yn codi pryderon am yr effaith ar bobl anabl sydd yn byw gyda chyflyrau meddygol cynharach

Rydym yn hynod o bryderus nad oes mesurau angenrheidiol yn cael eu cymryd i leihau marwolaethau yn y grwpiau yma.

Rydym yn neilltuol o bryderus:

Mae’r GIG yng Nghymru a Lloegr eisoes wedi’u tangyllido ac yn cael trafferth i ymdopi gyda galw. Mae hyn yn golygu na fydd gweithwyr GIG, pe digwydd achosion lu, yn gallu darparu gofal digonol i bob claf. Mae’r adroddiadau o’r Eidal, lle mae’r pandemig ar gam mwy datblygiedig, yn eithriadol o bryderus. Nodwn nad ydy rhai pobl yn yr Eidal eisoes yn derbyn triniaeth oherwydd diffyg adnoddau. Rhaid i Lywodraethau’r DU a Chymru wneud popeth o fewn eu gallu nawr i atal gwneud penderfyniadau cyffelyb ar uchafbwynt y pandemig.

I bobl anabl, mae llawer o’r cyngor ar sut i osgo heintio (e.e. hunanynysu, cadw pellter cymdeithasol) yn amhosibl i’w ddilyn yn enwedig i’r rhai sydd angen cymorth dyddiol ac mae’r un mor wir i bobl sydd yn gyflogedig fel cynorthwywyr personol neu weithwyr gofal a chefnogaeth. Rhaid i Lywodraethau’r DU a Chymru weithredu ar frys i gynnig cefnogaeth i bobl anabl sydd angen Cynorthwywyr Personol neu weithwyr gofal a chefnogaeth i ddarparu cymorth dyddiol a hefyd i’r Cynorthwywyr Personol a gofalwyr eu hunain.

Mae nifer o ddarparwyr gofal a chefnogaeth wedi cael eu heffeithio yn ariannol yn dilyn 10 mlynedd o fesurau cyni gan esgor ar weithlu dan bwysau. Rydym yn bryderus am ansawdd y gofal y gellir ei ddarparu pan fo gweithwyr gofal yn hunanynysu neu yn mynd yn sâl. Rhaid i Lywodraethau’r DU a Chymru greu cynlluniau cydgysylltiedig ar frys ynghylch sut i ymateb i brinder gweithwyr gofal. Rhaid rhoi cefnogaeth ariannol sylweddol nawr yn arbennig i ddarparwyr gofal i recriwtio gweithwyr gofal ychwanegol a gallu cynnig cyflogau da i’r gweithwyr gofal yma.

Gyda’i gilydd mae’r ffactorau yma yn ein harwain i gredu bod pobl anabl yn debygol o wynebu niwed, nid yn unig drwy’r Coronafeirws ei hun ond drwy’r pwysau cyffredinol ar y system iechyd a gofal, yn ogystal â rhwystrau cymdeithasol ehangach. Mae Llywodraeth y DU wedi cyhoeddi cyllid argyfwng o £5 biliwn i wasanaethau cyhoeddus i liniaru’r pwysau oherwydd Coronafeirws.

Fel cyrff sydd yn cynrychioli buddiannau pobl anabl, rydym yn galw am gefnogaeth brys o’r gronfa yma i sicrhau bod darpariaeth gofal cymdeithasol a chefnogaeth yn derbyn adnoddau digonol yng Nghymru. Anogwn Llywodraethau’r DU a Chymru i ymyrryd ar frys i sicrhau nad ydy pobl anabl yn cael eu trin fel colledion anochel yn y pandemig hwn."

So, is long COVID a disability?","ehrc, person, act, equality, condition, conditions, disability, covid, effects, long","Legal Update by Bela Gor, Head of Legal & Content, Business Disability Forum

Is long COVID a disability?

Last week the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) unhelpfully tweeted that “Discussions continue on whether ‘long COVID’ symptoms constitute a disability. Without case law or scientific consensus, EHRC does not recommend that ‘long COVID’ be treated as a disability.” This set the Twittersphere chattering or should that be cheeping? The EHRC did subsequently issue a clarification of this sweeping, and incorrect, statement.

Whether a particular condition is a disability is a question we are regularly asked. The answer is simple if unhelpful – it depends.

As the EHRC said in its clarification, the Equality Act 2010 lists only three conditions by name; cancer, Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and HIV which are disabilities from the date of diagnosis. This means that any other condition, including long COVID, might be a disability if the effects of that condition meet the conditions of the Equality Act 2010.

These conditions are that the effects of the condition are:

long-term i.e. must last or be expected to last for at least 12 months or the rest of the person’s life if shorter; and

substantial i.e. more than minor or trivial

and affect the person’s ability to carry out normal day to day activities.

This is a broad definition and there are other factors to consider like the effect of treatment on the condition, which make the definition of disability more complex than it sounds. It is also a legal definition, so any medical consensus as mentioned by the EHRC is irrelevant. Medical professionals cannot say definitively that a person is or is not disabled for the purposes of the Equality Act 2010.

I have spent days, sometimes weeks, before a tribunal trying to prove that conditions ranging from a hernia to a rare auto-immune condition were disabilities – yes in both cases because of the effects of that condition on that individual. This does not mean that everyone with a hernia or the same auto-immune condition will be disabled for the purposes of the Equality Act. Case law on long COVID is unlikely to determine that all cases of long COVID will be disabilities, contrary to the EHRC tweet.

The deciding factor is not the diagnosis. No diagnosis is needed for a condition to be a disability under the Equality Act. What must be proved is that the person has something (yes that vague) that is having a long-term and substantial adverse on that person’s normal day-to-day activities. There have been successful cases where medical professionals didn’t know what was causing the symptoms the person was experiencing but were agreed that those symptoms had a substantial adverse effect on normal day-to-day activities that lasted or were likely to do so for 12 months or more.

So, is long COVID a disability? The answer is that it could be for a particular individual, in the same way as any other condition could be a disability depending on the effects on that person. It is a case-by-case decision.

What does this mean in practical terms for employers? Don’t waste time and energy on trying to decide if someone is disabled by their long COVID, or any other condition. Instead of asking (and paying) lawyers to argue the case for weeks in a tribunal, ask the employee and yourselves what reasonable adjustments would enable the person to work. For advice on adjustments and what is meant by reasonable contact our Advice Service at advice@businessdisabilityforum.org.uk or call 020 7402 3020."

Our expert employment law team discuss the first case dealing with the status of long covid and what it means for employers.

In Burke v Turning Point Scotland, the employment tribunal found that the claimant, who was suffering from long covid, was disabled under the Equality Act 2010. This defines a disability as a physical or a mental impairment that has a substantial and long-term adverse effect on one’s ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities.

In this case, Mr Burke was employed as a caretaker and after contracting covid-19 in November 2020, initially experienced mild symptoms. However, he later developed severe fatigue and headaches. He was unable to do basic daily chores like shopping or cooking. He struggled to stand for long periods of time, experienced joint pain, loss of appetite, and was not able to concentrate when watching TV.

Although he was keen to return to work, his symptoms were unpredictable. Mr Burke remained off sick and was dismissed by his employer in August 2021 on the grounds of ill health and the “uncertainty around a potential return to work date.” As a result, Mr Burke claimed that he was discriminated against on the basis of his disability – long covid. The tribunal had to determine whether Mr Burke’s long covid amounted to a disability under the Equality Act.

When they applied the criteria of the Equality Act to the symptoms that Mr Burke was suffering, they found that these were long term, had a substantial adverse effect on his ability to carry out normal activities, and he was therefore disabled. The claim was brought in the employment tribunal only, and was not appealed, so it is not binding. However, it’s the first case dealing with the status of long covid and unlikely to be the last, given the prevalence of the condition.

The decision itself is not ground-breaking and certainly does not mean that all cases of long covid will amount to a disability, but it does act as an important reminder.

All employers managing sickness absence relating to any ongoing health condition should always bear in mind that it could amount to a disability if it fulfils the Equality Act’s specified criteria.

Employers have a duty to make reasonable adjustments for disabled employees to undertake their role and failure to do so may result in a disability discrimination claim. It’s therefore crucial for employers to establish whether an employee is disabled and what adjustments may be required.

Our expertise was acknowledged recently when we were granted permission by the High Court to intervene in the Keira Bell v Tavistock & Portman NHS Trust judicial review.

Established in 2015, Transgender Trend has led the way in advocating for the rights of children to reject gender stereotypes and be who they really are without discrimination, labelling or medical intervention to ‘fix’ them.



We believe all children have the right to go through puberty and reach adulthood with their fertility intact and that this is a fundamental human right.



We believe that children with gender dysphoria deserve evidence-based treatment and have a right to the same duty of care as any other child.

Our message is:

No child is born in the wrong body.

Transgender Trend advocates for the most vulnerable children who are caught up in the recent trend in society to replace the objective reality of sex with the subjective idea of ‘gender identity’ as the criteria for being a man or being a woman. ‘Gender identity’ ideology teaches children who don’t conform to masculine or feminine stereotypes that their personalities are ‘wrong’ for their sex, and their bodies are then ‘wrong’ for their gender identity.

The number of children and young people who now believe they are really the opposite sex is reflected in the unprecedented recent trend in referrals to the Tavistock Gender Identity Development Service.

Boys and girls should be able to wear what they like and have whatever interests they choose without adult interpretation through the lens of a non-scientific, ideological belief that human beings are born with an innate sense of being male or female, which is inevitably based on sex stereotypes.

In school, acceptance of a boy who likes to play with dolls as a girl is no acceptance at all.

Acceptance of a lesbian adolescent girl as a straight boy is no acceptance at all.

This approach only serves to reinforce restrictive and harmful stereotypes. ‘Affirmation’ is not kind, it affirms to a child that they are the wrong sex and encourages a child’s belief that their body needs medically changing. Medical intervention can only ever effect cosmetic change; the child’s sex remains the same.

We advocate for the rights of lesbian and gay young people to grow up as lesbian or gay. We advocate for the rights of autistic children and those with mental health problems or background trauma to receive proper therapeutic care, not a ‘diagnosis’ that they are really the opposite sex. All children and young people deserve treatment based on clinical evidence, not ideology.

In schools all children deserve to be taught science-based facts, not ideology disguised as ‘fact’. All children have the right to privacy from the opposite sex in toilets and changing-rooms. Policy in schools must always put safeguarding first and schools should not use resources that confuse children about sex.



Children should not be coerced into expressing a belief in ‘gender identity’ through the threat that not to do so is ‘unkind’ or ‘transphobic’.

0:00 / 1× We've spoken to experts from leading organisations in sexual health and virology.

But I did start talking to all kinds of people: experts, people who’ve had the virus, and to those who see this outbreak as part of a much bigger picture.

Mpox has spread worldwide - and for many of us queer people, the response has felt bit too familiar. You see history rarely repeats - but it often rhymes.

Tune in to steal our insight on this virus, what it means for our community and how we should handle it. Together, let's work out just What The Pox? is going on?

with conversations about and And crucially, we answer: What can we do next?

""I felt so alone"" What the Pox? Is the information and support I wish I had at my disposal when I was going through Monkeypox. If you think what we've done counts, will you take a look at how you can support our podcast? Support What the Pox?

I revamped their website with the help of another website designer.

Along the way, I became part of a team putting together A Legacy of Kindness project. This important project aims to record the history of GIRES through the voices of those from its inception to the present. During that process I filmed 15 people who are/were integral parts of GIRES.

As part of the LGBT+ History Month, February 2023, I edited together those 15 hours into a 40 minute film which was shown at the Cinema Museum in London on the 28th February.

Here is your opportunity to see this film for yourself. It is called Voices: Recording Trans History for the Future.

I am also writing another book called The Nowhere Chronicles which is a metaphor for my journey in life. Hopefully, it will be a record to which I can return to see where I have travelled in my fall down the rabbit hole to find a deeper peace and release.

Here is (very) short quote from the initial part of the book read by a great friend, Caroline Baldock, who tells stories. Sometimes, the voice brings more to the words as they hold their own energy, and that comes across when spoken.

Are you afraid to be vulnerable?

Would you like to learn how to be more authentic, open and honest?

Would you like all your relationships to be more fulfilling?

Would you like to release decades of suppressed emotion and feeling?

When we’re born, we’re a blank canvas of possibility and opportunity. We’re born with courage in our hearts and vibrancy in our souls. As soon as we take our first breath, the first brush strokes are made on the canvas as our experiences, environment and upbringing create landscapes and abstract textures. Slowly, over time, this can redefine our essence of Self as we take on the beliefs, ideals, expectations, judgements and pain of others, as well as our own choices and decisions carving out new shapes and dimensions.

My own journey in life took me to a place of deep pain. My experiences led me down some dark and challenging pathways. I allowed the blank canvas of me to be covered in the paint of people’s needs and wants, expectations and limits, and I also tried to paint the masterpiece I thought I ought to create thereby hiding the true me in the process.

Whilst I spent time trying to brush over what others had painted, this left the unexpressed anger and rage hiding underneath. Not only did I have to remove their paint, but I had to acknowledge, and take responsibility for, my own choices and brushstrokes in order to re-discover the pristine canvas of me once again and to accept myself as my perfectly imperfect Self. It was only then that I could paint my own shades of harmony; the real me.

This book then is a philosophical and spiritual paint remover wrapped in metaphor.

A Way of Seeing: It’s All a Matter of Perception, is my journey from restriction to freedom, from constraint to choice, from imprisonment to liberty.

Do you want to experience this for yourself?

Do you want to experience freedom, choice and liberty?

If so, step into the unknown with me as your guide.

A Way of Seeing is available on Amazon.

Some of the book’s content is already available on this website so you can get a flavour of my writing style. There is so much more in the book."
